## Neutrona Wand				

**Features:**

- Activate switch turns on the pack and wand.
- The orange switch on the wand switches between the 4 different firing modes. Setting 5 is a settings menu system.	

### Wand Settings Menu System							
When you are in the settings menu system, the bargraph leds begin flashing. All other functions of the wand are disabled while in the menu system.

There are 5 different menu settings, which are indicated by the bargraph leds. 1 through 5. (1 led flashing means you are on menu 1). Use the rotary knob on the top of the wand to navigate the menu system.

| Menu Level | Purpose | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 5 | Music track loop settings | Press Intensify to set the current track to loop forever. Press again to turn off the loop feature. (note that the LED #5 will stay solid when loop is enabled, it will blink on/off when looping is disabled). |
| 4 | Overall system volume | Press Intensify to increase volume, press the orange mode switch to decrease volume. |
| 3 | Adjust independent music volume | Press Intensify to increase volume, press the orange mode switch to decrease volume. |
| 2 | Switches music track | Press Intensify to cycle forward. Press the orange mode switch to cycle backwards. |
| 1 | Plays or stops the current music track | Press Intensify to play music. Press it again to stop the music. |

To exit the menu system, goto Menu 5 and press the Orange mode switch button, the wand will now go to the Proton stream mode.	

The music will play even when the pack and wand are turned off. When music is playing while they are turned off, you can use the Rotary knob on the top of the wand to easily access independent music volume control.

To add more music, copy the stereo wav tracks (44khz stereo wav files) onto the SD card of the pack and wand. File naming of the music tracks start at 100. So for example, 100_somesong.wav, 101_somesong.wav, 102_somesong.wav, etc. Do not have any gaps in the number sequencing. For example, 100_somesong.wav, 102_somesong.wav but no 101_somesong.wav on the sd card. The only important part in the naming is the XXX_ for the tracks.

## Wand Power Modes

There are 5 wand power modes, indicated by the bargraph leds. Use the rotary knob on top of the wand to change power modes. The wand will fire forever on modes 1 through 4. On mode 5, the wand and pack will overheat after a X amount of time of firing.
