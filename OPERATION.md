[Haslab Proton Pack Arduino Powered Demo & Features](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhGX1oJBNHk)

## Proton Pack		

### Features

- The switch underneath the ion arm can turn the pack on or off.
- You can run the pack without the cyclotron lid on.
- Alarm ribbon cable will activate the alarm.
- The pack can run without a wand.
- Vibration switch in the cyclotron switch plate enables or disables the vibration motors for both the pack and wand.
- 1984/2021 year switch in the cyclotron switch plate changes the pack and wand from 1984 (OG) to 2021 (Afterlife) modes.

## Neutrona Wand				

### Features

- Activate switch on the gun box turns on both the pack and wand.
- Right-hand toggles affect the vent light and additional sound effects (see below).
	- Note that for both 2021 and 1984 modes, the wand will not fire unless these switches are turned on (plus the lever switch near the gunbox has been pulled to extend the barrel).
- The orange switch at the end of the wand switches between the available firing modes:
	1. Proton Stream (Default)
	1. Slime Gun
	1. Statis
	1. Meson Collider
	1. Special: Setting 5 is a settings menu system (see below).
	
**Toggles**

- While in 1984 mode:
	- Bottom right switch turns on the vent light and plays the wand power up sound.
	- Top right switch plays a single beep sound.
- While in 2021 mode:
	- Bottom right switch turns on the vent light and the wand plays a ramp up sound.
 	- Top right switch turns on the looping beeping sounds.

### Wand Settings Menu System							
When you are in the settings menu system, the bargraph leds begin flashing. All other functions of the wand are disabled while in the menu system. There are 5 different menu settings, which are indicated by the bargraph LED's 1 through 5. For example, when 1 LED is flashing that means you are on menu 1. Use the rotary knob on the top of the wand to navigate the menu system!

| Menu Level | Purpose | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 5 | Music track loop settings | Press Intensify to set the current track to loop forever. Press again to turn off the loop feature. (Note that the LED #5 will stay solid when loop is enabled, it will blink on/off when looping is disabled). |
| 4 | Overall system volume | Press Intensify to increase volume, press the orange mode switch to decrease volume. |
| 3 | Adjust independent music volume | Press Intensify to increase volume, press the orange mode switch to decrease volume. |
| 2 | Switches music track | Press Intensify to cycle forward. Press the orange mode switch to cycle backwards. |
| 1 | Plays or stops the current music track | Press Intensify to play music. Press it again to stop the music. |

To exit the menu system, goto Menu 5 and press the Orange mode switch button, the wand will now go to the Proton stream mode. The music will play even when the pack and wand are turned off. When music is playing while the pack and wand are turned off, you can use the Rotary knob on the top of the wand to easily access independent music volume control.

To add more music, copy stereo wav tracks (44khz stereo wav files) onto the SD card of the pack and wand. File naming of the music tracks start at 100. So for example, 100_somesong.wav, 101_somesong.wav, 102_somesong.wav, etc. **Do not leave any gaps in the number sequencing!** (For example of what NOT to do, 100_somesong.wav, 102_somesong.wav leaving off 101_somesong.wav on the SD card.) The only important part in the naming is the XXX_ for all tracks.

## Wand Power Modes

There are 5 wand power modes, indicated by the bargraph leds. Use the rotary knob on top of the wand to change power modes. The wand will fire forever on modes 1 through 4. On mode 5, the wand and pack will overheat after a certain amount of time of firing.
