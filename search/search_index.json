Neutrona Wand - \"Proton Gun/Wand\" by DoctorEgon on Thingiverse Single-Shot Blaster - \"Ghostbusters Inspired Wrist Blaster\" by Samuel Barab\u00e9 on Thingiverse Project History Work began in December of 2022 by Michael Rajotte through regular posts on the GBFans forum. Initial efforts focused on creation of a \"cheat device\" or more commonly referred to as a \"keepalive mod\" which would defeat the automatic power-down feature built into the Habro Haslab equipment. By January of 2023 most of the worldwide community were receiving their orders from Hasbro and interest in such cheat devices was growing. At this stage Michael was successful in creating a working mod though it required soldering to delicate components within the Neutrona Wand which was outside the skillset of many end-users. Though once a minimal keepalive solution was found, Michael began experimenting with other features such as cyclotron lights and audio upgrades. Conversations with Jonathan Gunn about potential features exposed some obvious limitations with the Haslab equipment, and so the idea of a microcontroller replacement was born. By late January the wand had a working prototype using an Arduino Nano to control the built-in hardware and work began on the pack controller. Within weeks the pack was running its core functions from an Arduino as well and both devices could communicate with each other for effects and operations. Interest from the community was growing, as was the list of requests for features. Progress updates continued on the GBFans forums as new prototyping work began in the background through February. The introduction of the GitHub page for all source code and project files was introduced. Work also began to prototype and beta test Michael's schematics in the community. By early March the experimental hardware and software was replicated by Dustin Grau and efforts began to formally document instructions for the community. The first true replacement to the stock Haslab controllers was on its way to adoption but only by the most-skilled users. Michael continued adding features and modding his equipment to accommodate community requests. Documentation turned to schematics and video demonstrations, but was still a daunting prospect to most modders. Then in April a PCB schematic was created by Jonathan which changed everything--the idea would be to combine the electronic components which lived on protoboards onto a single board powered by a ATmega2560 chip. Several revisions were rapidly created and modified, and within weeks a prototype board for the pack was created and available. By May, both the pack and wand had viable prototypes which offered the same socket connections as their replaced originals, along with user-friendly options for attaching the wand components which were originally soldered to the stock controller. This was the breakthrough moment for the project. Handwritten notes turned into documentation, which turned into manufactured circuits, then gave way to a means of creating drop-in controllers that would be accessible to modders with a wider range of skills. Even those with no soldering abilities could pick up a screwdriver and install these components. At this stage Angie Rutto of Frutto Technology began working with Michael to identify add-on parts that could integrate with the controllers in use and a bevvy of new options became available. Replacement lights for the power cell and cyclotron lid allowed for full-color effects on the pack, while a new bargraph unit allowed for a plug-and-play upgrade for the wand. The project was now becoming a platform with supported accessories. Efforts then shifted from prototyping and revisional changes to potential worldwide distribution. Polls and preorders gauged the public interest and efforts began to turn components into kits. Michael, Jonathan, and Angie took on additional roles as regional distributors covering the EU, North America, and the UK (respectively). Jonathan created the first website for ordering and modders were able to submit their choice for base kits, special upgrade kits, and optional add-ons.","title":"About"},{"location":"ABOUT/#team-members","text":"This project is made possible by Ghostbusters community makers and volunteers spanning 4 countries over 2 continents.

The purpose of these changes is to set preferred defaults for the operation of your Proton Pack and Neutrona Wand at bootup, meaning just after the devices have battery power applied. These defaults will avoid the need to switch operation modes and other settings through the menu system. Please consider all items as changeable at your own risk. Deviating from any recommended values may impact the operation of your pack and wand and cause unwanted or odd behavior. Bug reports or issues which arise from modification of these values will be considered moot unless accompanied by copies of changed files to aid in reproducing the behavior. All user-configurable values reside within their respective Configuration.h file. Note that when loading the .ino file to the Arduino IDE this should load the related .h files automatically. For more information on how to compile and flash a custom binary after modifying Configuration.h , please see COMPILING_FLASHING.md for GPStar hardware or DIY_FLASHING.md for DIY Arduino builds. EEPROM Data For those who customise their settings and flash their boards manually, any saved settings in the Proton Pack or Neutrona Wand EEPROM can override some settings that you manually flash to your Proton Pack or Neutrona Wand's main system memory. Examples include the Cyclotron and Power Cell Delays, the number of LEDs defined for the Power Cell or Cyclotron, overheating options, etc. You can either override the EEPROM settings by setting b_eeprom = false in the Proton Pack and or Neutrona Wand Configuration.h file before flashing or clearing all the saved settings in your EEPROM from the EEPROM LED Menu System and EEPROM Configuration Menu System. Refer to the Operation Manual for more information on how to enter the different EEPROM menu systems. EEPROM data saving and menu system is only available while using the GPStar Neutrona Wand board with your Neutrona Wand, or via the web interface when using an ESP32 wireless module or Attenuator. The EEPROM memory has a specified life of 100,000 write/erase cycles. You will generally not reach this limit in your lifetime, but if you did or wish to disable the EEPROM loading system, refer to const bool b_eeprom in the Proton Pack table below. Proton Pack Variable Description Default Setting uint8_t i_cyclotron_leds Cyclotron Lid LED count. There are 12 LEDs in the stock HasLab Cyclotron Lid. If you install a 40 LED NeoPixel ring in your Cyclotron Lid, then this should be set to 40. The Cyclotron Lid can support up to 40 (rgbw) addressable LEDs such as NeoPixels (WS2812B). They will change colour accordingly if you switch to video game modes firing modes. 36 #define CYCLOTRON_DELAY_1984 This sets the delay in milliseconds when an LED changes on the Cyclotron Lid in 1984/1989 mode when b_fade_cyclotron_led is set to false . 300 #define CYCLOTRON_DELAY_TVG This sets the delay in milliseconds when an LED changes on the Cyclotron Lid in 1984/1989 mode when b_fade_cyclotron_led is set to true . 500 const uint16_t i_1984_delay This controls the delay in milliseconds when an LED changes on the Cyclotron Lid in 1984/1989 mode. Note that this setting changes automatically based on the value of b_fade_cyclotron_led. CYCLOTRON_DELAY_TVG #define CYCLOTRON_DELAY_2021_12_LED This controls the delay in milliseconds when an LED changes on the Cyclotron Lid in 2021/2024 mode when using the stock Haslab 12 LED setup. 15 #define CYCLOTRON_DELAY_2021_20_LED This controls the delay in milliseconds when an LED changes on the Cyclotron Lid in 2021/2024 mode when using a Frutto Technology 20 LED setup. 10 #define CYCLOTRON_DELAY_2021_36_LED This controls the delay in milliseconds when an LED changes on the Cyclotron Lid in 2021/2024 mode when using a Frutto Technology Max 36 LED setup. 5 #define CYCLOTRON_DELAY_2021_40_LED This controls the delay in milliseconds when an LED changes on the Cyclotron Lid in 2021/2024 mode when using a 40 LED NeoPixel ring. 7 const uint8_t i_1984_cyclotron_12_leds_cw[4] This is the middle LED aligned in each Cyclotron lens. Put the sequence in order from lowest to highest in a clockwise direction. The top right lens is the Cyclotron lens #1 and work your way clockwise. This is for the stock Haslab LED setup. { 1, 4, 7, 10 } const uint8_t i_1984_cyclotron_12_leds_ccw[4] This is the middle LED aligned in each Cyclotron lens. Put the sequence in order from lowest to highest in a counter-clockwise direction. The top right lens is the Cyclotron lens #1 and work your way counter-clockwise. This is for the stock Haslab LED setup. { 1, 10, 7, 4 } const uint8_t i_1984_cyclotron_20_leds_cw[4] This is the middle LED aligned in each Cyclotron lens. Put the sequence in order from lowest to highest in a clockwise direction. The top right lens is the Cyclotron lens #1 and work your way clockwise. This is for the Frutto Technology 20 LED setup. { 2, 7, 12, 17 } const uint8_t i_1984_cyclotron_20_leds_ccw[4] This is the middle LED aligned in each Cyclotron lens. Put the sequence in order from lowest to highest in a counter-clockwise direction. The top right lens is the Cyclotron lens #1 and work your way counter-clockwise. This is for the Frutto Technology 20 LED setup. { 2, 17, 12, 7 } const uint8_t i_1984_cyclotron_36_leds_cw[4] This is the middle LED aligned in each Cyclotron lens. Put the sequence in order from lowest to highest in a clockwise direction. The top right lens is the Cyclotron lens #1 and work your way clockwise. This is for the Frutto Technology Max 36 LED setup. { 4, 13, 22, 31 } const uint8_t i_1984_cyclotron_36_leds_ccw[4] This is the middle LED aligned in each Cyclotron lens. Put the sequence in order from lowest to highest in a counter-clockwise direction. The top right lens is the Cyclotron lens #1 and work your way counter-clockwise. This is for the Frutto Technology Max 36 LED setup. { 4, 31, 22, 13 } const uint8_t i_1984_cyclotron_40_leds_cw[4] This is the middle LED aligned in each Cyclotron lens. Put the sequence in order from lowest to highest in a clockwise direction. The top right lens is the Cyclotron lens #1 and work your way clockwise. This is for the 40 NeoPixel Ring LED setup. { 0, 10, 18, 28 } const uint8_t i_1984_cyclotron_40_leds_ccw[4] This is the middle LED aligned in each Cyclotron lens. Put the sequence in order from lowest to highest in a counter-clockwise direction. The top right lens is the Cyclotron lens #1 and work your way counter-clockwise. This is for the 40 NeoPixel Ring LED setup. { 0, 28, 18, 10 } bool b_clockwise Set to true for the Cyclotron lights to spin clockwise. Set to false to be counter clockwise. This can be controlled by an optional switch on pin 29. This can be toggled from the Neutrona Wand sub menu system. true bool b_fade_cyclotron_led When set to false , the LEDs on the Cyclotron Lid in 1984/1989 mode will not fade between lens transitions which is closer to their appearance in the films. Set to true to get an appearance closer to the 2009 video game. This can be toggled from the Neutrona Wand sub menu system. true bool b_cyclotron_single_led When set to true , the LEDs on the Cyclotron Lid will light up the middle LED only per Cyclotron lens in 1984 and 1989 mode. When set to false , 3 LEDs per lens will be displayed instead. This can be toggled from the Neutrona Wand sub menu system. true bool b_cyclotron_simulate_ring When set to true , using LEDs that are not a ring will simulate a ring rotation for the Cyclotron LEDs in the lid. This only affects Afterlife and Frozen Empire modes (2021/2024). This has no effect if you are using a 40 pixel ring in your Cyclotron Lid. true bool b_cyclotron_colour_toggle If you are using Cyclotron Lid LEDs and Inner Cyclotron LEDs with RGB support, such as the Frutto Technology Cyclotron LEDs or NeoPixel Rings etc. You can toggle if you want it to change colours to match the Video Game Modes or stay the default Red at all times. The default setting is true , which makes the Cyclotron Lid and Inner Cyclotron change colours to match the Video Game Modes. This has no affect on the stock HasLab Cyclotron Lid LEDs, which are red only. This can be toggled in the Neutrona Wand sub menu system. true const bool b_cyclotron_haslab_chsv_colour_change When using 12 LEDs for the Cyclotron Lid (Stock HasLab), the system will default it to always white because changing the colour space with a CHSV colour object affects the brightness slightly for non-RGB pixels such as the ones used in the HasLab Cyclotron Lid. If you are using 12 LEDs that are RGB, they will always be white when this is set to false . Setting this to true will override it and make the LEDs change colour if they are RGB. This only affects when you are using 12 LEDs for the Cyclotron Lid (HasLab) false uint8_t i_powercell_leds Power Cell LED count. There are 13 LEDs in the stock HasLab Power Cell. If you install a Frutto Technology Power Cell which has 15 LEDs, then change this to 15. You can also add your own addressable LEDs, adjust the count as necessary. If you add more Power Cell LEDs, you may want to adjust the i_powercell_delay_2021 and i_powercell_delay_1984 to lower numbers to speed up the Power Cell delay to reflect the additional LEDs. 15 #define POWERCELL_DELAY_1984_13_LED This controls the delay in milliseconds when an LED changes on the Power Cell in 1984/1989 mode when using a 13 LED Power Cell. 46 #define POWERCELL_DELAY_2021_13_LED This controls the delay in milliseconds when an LED changes on the Power Cell in 2021/2024 mode when using a 13 LED Power Cell. 40 #define POWERCELL_DELAY_1984_15_LED This controls the delay in milliseconds when an LED changes on the Power Cell in 1984/1989 mode when using a 15 LED Power Cell. 40 #define POWERCELL_DELAY_2021_15_LED This controls the delay in milliseconds when an LED changes on the Power Cell in 2021/1989 mode when using a 15 LED Power Cell. 34 uint8_t i_powercell_delay_1984 This is the actual control variable for the Power Cell LED delay in 1984/1989 mode. It is recommended to change the above defines and only change this variable to the appropriate define for your LED configuration. POWERCELL_DELAY_1984_15_LED uint8_t i_powercell_delay_2021 This is the actual control variable for the Power Cell LED delay in 2021/2024 mode. It is recommended to change the above defines and only change this variable to the appropriate define for your LED configuration. POWERCELL_DELAY_2021_15_LED bool b_powercell_invert Set to true to invert the Power Cell animation. false bool b_powercell_colour_toggle If you are using Power Cell LEDs with RGB support, such as the Frutto Technology Power Cells, you can toggle if you want it to change colours to match the Video Game Modes or stay the default Blue at all times. The default setting is false as the Power Cell did not change colors in the 2009 video game. Set to true to make the Power Cell change colours to match the Video Game Modes. This has no affect on the stock HasLab Power Cell LEDs, which are blue only. This can be toggled in the Neutrona Wand sub menu system. false uint8_t i_inner_cyclotron_cake_num_leds This setting controls how many optional LEDs are in the Inner (cake) Cyclotron. Default setting of 35 is for a 35 pixel NeoPixel ring. If you change this for a smaller NeoPixel ring, you may need to alter the i_2021_inner_delay and i_1984_inner_delay to lower values to slow down the rotation speed for a smaller ring. 35 LED_TYPES CAVITY_LED_TYPE Sets the default LED type for the inner cyclotron cavity fairy lights. Choices are RGB_LED , GRB_LED or GBR_LED . RGB_LED uint8_t i_inner_cyclotron_cavity_num_leds You can use up to 20 LEDs.

Example: 30000 is 30 seconds 30000 bool b_stream_effects When set to true , various impact and other stream effects will overlap and mix randomly into the Proton Stream for an added experience. This can be toggled from the Neutrona Wand sub menu system true bool b_extra_pack_sounds When set to true , the Proton Pack will play sounds that the Neutrona Wand would normally play alone. Useful when running a Neutrona Wand build without a speaker. true const bool b_eeprom Set to true if you want to read the configuration data from the EEPROM memory in the Neutrona Wand. The EEPROM memory has a specified life of 100,000 write/erase cycles. You will generally not reach this limit in your lifetime, but if you did, it can be disabled to bypass it. true const bool b_wand_standalone Set this to true if you want to use your Neutrona Wand without a Proton Pack connected. Otherwise when false , the Neutrona Wand will wait until it is connected to a Proton Pack before it can activate. false","title":"Neutrona Wand"},{"location":"ATTENUATOR/","text":"Pack Attenuator (Optional) A special port labelled \"RX1/TX1\" (or \"Attenuator\" on later PCBs) exists as an expansion port for supporting the Pack Attenuator, allowing for more interactions with your Proton Pack and Neutrona Wand system.

Overview \"If Egon had kept on using and modifying his pack and modifying it, what might it look like?\" That was the question posed by Jason Reitman to Adam Savage with regards to the 2021 Ghostbusters Afterlife film. So in 2022 Adam Savage's Tested YouTube channel released a video for a \"1 Day Build\" which featured propmaster Ben Eadie to create a unique item which brings more life to the front of the Proton Pack. This guide demonstrates the build process for replicating the \"Pack Attenuator\" device first created by Adam and Ben which fully integrates into the GPStar electronics kit. The ability to control and receive feedback from the devices makes this more than just an aesthetic improvement but a truly usable piece of the pack-wand combination. Potential Backstory The device was rediscovered by Phoebe Spengler from notes in her grandfather\u2019s underground workshop on the \u201cDirt Farm\u201d. The device was theorized and prototyped but never put into service until now. The attenuator device alters the magnetic field to maintain a correct \u201crate of feed\u201d of positrons into the cyclotron, thus allowing the user to extend the time to ensnare a ghost by preventing an overheat event within the Proton Pack. Ahead of an overheat (aka. vent sequence) the device will provide physical and audiovisual cues as to the impending event. Interacting with the device will cancel the warning and stave off the venting sequence. Reference Videos Attenuator Preview Demonstration (YouTube, August 2023).

At this time the pack operator can turn the primary dial either direction to \"attenuate\" the pack and cancel the current warning. If the warning time is allowed to expire the the pack will enter the venting sequence. Lockout Mode (Main Dial) Lockout mode is a special option for only the main dial to prevent accidental changing of volume: 1) Press down on the main dial and immediately change the Right Toggle to the opposite position. If on, switch off, or vice-versa. 1) Continue to hold down the main dial for another second. If vibration feedback is enabled you will feel a long buzz to indicate when the lockout mode is either enabled or disabled (there will be no buzzer sound like there is during a menu level change). Buzzer/Vibration Feedback As part of the user experience, some actions initiated on the device or as a result of using your Proton Pack will trigger haptic feedback via a piezo buzzer and a vibration motor.

Printing a Shell The STL files are available through this repository if you have the capability of printing your own Attenuator shell. Please see the accompanying PDF in that directory for more details. Bill of Materials This device has it's own BOM which is separate from any other build items related to the pack or wand. This utilizes the same project template for developing software as the other controllers and we'll be using the same type of serial protocol as used between the pack and wand.

Microprocessor Control Unit (MCU) An ESP32 controller provides the full range of features to integrate with the Proton Pack and Neutrona Wand hardware. Use of an Arduino Nano is no longer supported due to the limitations of that hardware. ESP-WROOM-32 30-pin Dev Board w/ Terminal Shield or ESP-WROOM-32 Dev Board w/out Headers Exterior Decorations This device was designed to allow for certain \"real\" parts as opposed to being 100% 3D printed. To finish the look of the exterior the following are merely suggestions . These parts may be sourced from any vendor you prefer (in the US most ACE Hardware locations have extensive selections of metrics screws). If a certain item is improbable or unavailable you may substitute as you wish--regardless of material used for printing it should be possible to install a similar sized screw for the provided holes in the shell.

M4x6 Heat-set Inserts (Qty: 4) - Used to secure the base plate to a plastic body. Device labels can be obtained or created by any means desired. The sizes offered by this product on GBFans should be sufficient. Lower Mode/Indicator: Clear Dome Lens or Fluted Dome Lens Top Mode/Indicator: Clip-in Lens SML_190_CTP Dimensions It is worth noting that the device is meant to attach to the left shoulder strap of a standard ALICE pack. The width of the strap is typically around 80mm while worn, so this device will fit near perfectly once the strap is pressed against your shoulder/chest. These are the overall dimensions if you wish to approximate the needed space or design your own enclosure. Maintaining these dimensions ensures the components above will fit within the enclosure. Width: 80mm Height: 115mm Depth: 38mm WiFi Connectivity A primary benefit of using an ESP32 controller it is possible to connect to the device via WiFi. The SSID (Network Name) will be broadcast as either \"GPStar_Attenuator\" or \"ProtonPack_####\" where \"####\" is the last 4 hexadecimal values for the MAC address of the WiFi interface. This will differ for each ESP32 device, making each network unique to the attached pack. The default password is \"555-2368\" and can (and should) be changed via the web interface after successfully connecting to the network. The IP address for the device will be hardcoded as \"192.168.1.2\" with the web interface accessible at http://192.168.1.2 or simply http://GPStar_Attenuator.local or http://ProtonPack_####.local . Security Notice Once you have successfully paired with the WiFi network for the Proton pack, you are HIGHLY encouraged to change the default password. This is accessible via a link at the bottom of the main device page as noted above. Follow the prompts to enter and confirm a new password then re-join your pack's WiFi network with the new credentials. For instructions on using the web interface to control your equipment, please see the Wireless Operations guide. ESP32 - 30-Pin Reference \ud83d\udcdd Note: There are typically 30-pin and 38-pin versions of the ESP32 development modules and matching terminal shields. Both should work, though there will be some minor differences to the order of pins. ALWAYS match the GPIO pin by label not position or index. This guide uses the more compact 30-pin packaging. ESP32 - Pin Connections The following is a diagram of the ESP32 pins from left and right, when oriented with the USB connection facing down (south) like the pinout diagram above. This follows the standard pinout for a 30-pin device. Connection ESP32 (L) ESP32 (R) Connection EN GPIO23 Neopixels (2) GPIO36 GPIO22 SCL Bargraph GPIO39 GPIO1 Left Toggle GPIO34 GPIO3 Right Toggle GPIO35 GPIO21 SDA Bargraph Encoder A GPIO32 GPIO19 PN2222 Encoder B GPIO33 GPIO18 Piezo Buzzer GPIO25 GPIO5 GPIO26 GPIO17 to Pack RX1 2 GPIO27 GPIO16 to Pack TX1 2 GPIO14 GPIO4 Encoder Post GPIO12 GPIO2 GPIO13 GPIO15 Ground (Pack) GND GND Common Ground +5V (Pack) 5V/VIN 3.3V Vib. Motor + USB When connecting to the pack, the following wiring scheme was used with the recommended 4-pin connector: 1 - GND (Black) 2 - 5V/VIN (Red) 3 - TX2 (White) to Pack RX1<sup>2</sup> 4 - RX2 (Yellow) to Pack TX1<sup>2</sup> 2 This is on GPStar I Proton Pack boards. On GPStar II Proton Pack boards the data pins are labeled \"Attenuator RX2/TX2\". It is advised to add a 330uF capacitor to the VIN+GND pins to help regulate power which will be shared with the controller, bargraph, and addressable LEDs. Note: Bargraph power (+5V) should be split from the VIN terminal which delivers power from the Proton Pack. Connections by Component Wire colors are suggestions, and meant to help differentiate the components. You may use your own scheme as desired. Microcontroller (MCU) pins are labelled using their GPIO# designations. Common pins will retain a singular name. For the ESP32 controller, GPIO pins 34 and 35 are input-only and do not have internal pull-up resistors. In order to get an accurate reading from the state of the switch it is necessary to add a 3.8k \u03a9 resistor between the 3.3V (3V3) pin and the respective GPIO pin where the toggle switch connects to the controller. This is essentially a wire from the V+ pin to the noted GPIO pin, with the stated resistor on the wire. Both wires for the pull-up resistor and toggle switch will terminate at the same point on the controller.

It requires a common ground connection with positive voltage, and sends data via the A/B signal wires to indicate which direction it was turned or the center post was pushed. Note: This is based on the KY-040 pre-soldered module with 5 pins. ROTARY ENCODER (DIAL) MCU Pin GND \u2192 GND + (VCC) \u2192 5V/VIN SW \u2192 D4/GPIO4 DT (B) \u2192 D2/GPIO33 CLK (A) \u2192 D3/GPIO32 Addressable LEDs LED'S Component MCU Pin Red \u2192 100uf 5V/VIN Green \u2192 470 \u03a9 D9/GPIO23 Black \u2192 100uf GND Note: It is advised to place a 100uf capacitor across the positive and negative connections to these devices, just to buffer any current fluctuations. Addressable LEDs have a distinct data flow with solder pads labelled DIN and DOUT . It is crucial to chain these devices starting from the Arduino to an LEDs DIN pad first, then the same device's DOUT pad to the next LED's DIN pad, and so on.

To safely deliver power we will use an 2N2222/2N5551, an NPN Bipolar Transistor (BJT). A diode is recommended as this is a motor and thus could cause a small induction current in reverse when power is removed. Bargraph This is a separate but critical device and should be a relatively easy connection when using the Frutto Technology packaging which has only 2 ports: 5V/GND and SDA/SCL. Power will be connected to the \"5V\" on the Arduino and a common ground (GND). These are GPIO pins 21 and 22 for SDA and SCL, respectively. Note: For the ESP32 controller, GPIO pins 21 (SDA) and 22 (SCL) do not have internal pull-up resistors. In order to detect attached devices it is necessary to add a 3.8k \u03a9 resistor between the 3.3V (3V3) pin and the respective GPIO pin where the bargraph connects to the controller. This is essentially a wire from the V+ pin to the noted GPIO pin, with the stated resistor on the wire. Both wires for the pull-up resistor and data line will terminate at the same point on the controller.

This will consist of running the 4-conductor jacketed wire through the braided wire loom, and terminating with the 4-pin connector at one end and passing through the strain relief at the other end. The bare wires can be soldered directly to the microcontroller or use a terminal shield. Where the socket for this connection cable is mounted on the pack is up to you--this device is meant to integrate how you think it should. You will be able to use 2 existing JST-XH connections on the gpstar Pack PCB controller: 5V-OUT and TX1/RX1. Please refer to the wiring notes above for how to make this connections. Just remember that TX/RX from the Attenuator will go to RX/TX on the pack (read: the wires flip). Please see the notes above for the correct pin names for connections based on your choice of microcontroller. Component Fitment The dimensions of the project housing allows for easy access into all areas of the device. It should be no problem to fit the available components within the final device. Note that you will want to build the connection cable in full and run it through the strain relief before attached to the device housing. For assembly, the shell contains 4 holes meant to take heat-set inserts which provide metal-threaded junctions for screws to hold on the bottom plate. Because the plat must then be attached to the ALICE pack strap these should be secure but removable in the case of re-flashing software updates to the device.

Dupli-Color Adhesion Promoter Rustoleum Metallic Aluminum Aluminum Shells For the aluminum printed shells, you may want to first sand the exterior smooth prior to painting. This can be done easily using \"sanding sponges\" which come in a variety of grits from course to fine (available at most hardware stores). Generally 220 and higher will work well and not remove too much material. If you sand in only one direction across the surface you can achieve a brushed aluminum appearance in the final look. Regardless of whether you sand or not, be sure to wash your aluminum print with soap and water to remove any oil residues from your fingers during handling, and use gloves while finishing to ensure maximum adhesion for paint. General Supplies If you wish to have a chipped paint look you will want a solid, flat black paint. Rustoleum's truck bed liner is a heavy, textured paint which is used often for the Proton Pack shells and works well to give the needed look. You'll also want to mask some areas of the shell to help reveal those paint chips. Latex Masking Fluid Silicone Brushes Truck Bed Liner Spray Paint Use the silicone brushes to paint on a bit of the masking fluid where you do not wish the final coat of paint to stick, meaning the areas you want to show as chipped. These would typically be near edges or corners where you might see normal wear and tear from use, and can be somewhat chaotic or irregular. Be careful if applying a second coat as the latex may stick to the brush and peel away. Once the latext dries, you can apply a single coat of the truck bed liner. Apply a second coat per the product instructions to ensure any metallic areas are fully covered. Allow to dry thoroughly which may take upwards of 48 hours. Once dried, you can begin peeling away the latex-coated areas which will appear bumpy. Rub with your finger or scrape with your fingernail or a soft plastic scraper to avoid marring any metallic surface below (this is most important for the resin shell).

Going forward, only the ESP32 will be supported for the Attenuator device, whether purchased as a kit from Frutto Technologies or as a DIY solution. The ESP32 microcontroller is capable of supporting Over-The-Air (OTA) updates for firmware, meaning you will need to utilize a desktop web browser from a computer (not a mobile device or tablet) and the built-in WiFi access point provided by the controller as \"GPStar_Attenuator\" (or with the prefix: \"ProtonPack_\" ). However, please note the following special conditions! If you used an off-the-shelf ESP32 device, then the software which enables the WiFi access point is not yet loaded so you will need to follow the \"First-Time Upload\" for the initial upload of firmware to your device. If you are performing your first upgrade to the version v6.x firmware, you will need to perform the exact same process as the \"First-Time Upload\" to re-partition your device to accept the larger firmware files. Important Upgrades: V5.x \u2192 V6.x \ud83d\uded1 STOP, PLEASE READ! The partition scheme for the ESP32-based controllers has changed as of v6.0.0 to support a larger firmware file. This requires an update via USB cable for any users who were previously on a firmware release in v5.x or earlier. You will need to follow the \"First-Time Upload\" process to use a new, custom partition scheme on the device which provides a larger storage areas for Over-the-Air (OTA) updates. The standard flash memory of the ESP-WROOM-32 modules we use is limited to 4MB and must provide space to upload new firmware. For context, the default partition prioritized a \"SPIFFS\" area which was intended for file storage but is not used for our purposes. By removing that storage area we can allocate more space for larger firmware images (app0/app1), and adds an additional area for non-volatile storage (NVS). Old Scheme: nvs: 20kb otadata: 8kb app0: 1280kb (ota_0) app1: 1280kb (ota_1) spiffs: 1408kb coredump: 64kb New Scheme: nvs: 20kb otadata: 8kb app0: 1920kb (ota_0) app1: 1920kb (ota_1) nvs2: 128kb coredump: 64kb Once you have updated to a firmware from v6.x or later using the USB process, then then you may proceed to using the instructions for over-the-air (OTA/WiFi) updates without a USB cable as described in the \"Standard Updates\" section. For a more visual representation, please refer to this flowchart: ESP32: First-Time Upload (via USB) The following steps MUST be taken if either of these situations applies to you: If you are using your own ESP32 controller direct from Amazon or another supplier, then the microcontroller has not been flashed with the GPStar firmware to enable the OTA upload feature and the manual flashing process is required. Or, if you are performing the first firmware update since the introduction of v6.x you will need to perform the manual flashing process. We need to make room for larger firmware files and this can only be done by repartitioning the device's internal 4MB storage area. If you encounter any issues while attempting to access your ESP32 device via a USB cable, please see the \" USB Troubleshooting \" section at the bottom of this guide. Option 1: Using GPStar ESP32 Firmware Uploader This uses a purpose-built flash tool just like the tools for the Proton Pack, Neutrona Wand, Single-Shot Blaster and GPStar Audio. Thanks to its ease of use, this is our recommended method for performing the first-time USB upload process. First, download either the Windows or Mac OSX flash tool from the extras folder. If you are on Linux, try Option 2 below instead. Windows: GPStar ESP32 Firmware Flasher MacOS Intel/M1: GPStar ESP32 Firmware Flasher (Mac OSX) Plug your device into a USB port on your computer. Locate the following files from the /binaries/attenuator directory. extras/Attenuator-Bootloader.bin = This is the standard bootloader for the ESP32 itself. extras/Attenuator-Partitions.bin = This specifies the partition scheme for the flash memory. extras/boot_app0.bin = This is the software for selecting the available/next OTA partition. Attenuator.bin = This is the custom firmware for the GPStar kit. Open the GPStar ESP32 Firmware Flasher and browse to the files specified in step 2 above for each of the four requested file locations (see below screenshot). The program should automatically detect the correct COM port and baud rate (see above screenshot). If it did not, use the drop-down menus to select the correct one for your PC. Click the Upload button to flash the new firmware to your ESP32. Be patient, this process can take between 15 seconds and several minutes depending on the selected baud rate. Once the flash has completed successfully, your ESP32 should now be broadcasting a WiFi network and you should be ready to install it into your Proton Pack. If the flash failed, please see Solution 2 in the \" USB Troubleshooting \" section at the bottom of this guide to manually switch the ESP32 into bootloader mode. You may also try lowering the baud rate to 115200 (if available), though note this will increase the time it takes to flash the firmware. Option 2: Via Web Uploader This uses a 3rd-party website to upload using the Web Serial protocol which is only available on the Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Opera desktop web browsers. Mobile browsers are NOT supported, and you will be prompted with a message if your web browser is not valid for use. Plug your device into a USB port on your computer and go to http://espwebtool.ghostbusters.engineering (which redirects to https://esp.huhn.me ). Locate the following files from the /binaries/attenuator directory. extras/Attenuator-Bootloader.bin = This is the standard bootloader for the ESP32 itself. extras/Attenuator-Partitions.bin = This specifies the partition scheme for the flash memory. extras/boot_app0.bin = This is the software for selecting the available/next OTA partition. Attenuator.bin = This is the custom firmware for the GPStar kit. Click on the CONNECT button and select your USB serial device from the list of options and click on \"Connect\". Once connected, select the files (noted above) for the following address spaces: 0x1000 \u2192 Attenuator-Bootloader.bin 0x8000 \u2192 Attenuator-Partitions.bin 0xE000 \u2192 boot_app0.bin 0x10000 \u2192 Attenuator.bin Click on the PROGRAM button to begin flashing. View the \"Output\" window to view progress of the flashing operation. Once the device has completely flashed (100%) unplug the USB cable and remove any remaining power source from the device. Restore power to reboot the device and confirm operation. View a quick video of what this process should look like. Your list of USB devices may differ, and it may require selecting a different device if you cannot immediately determine which connected device is your ESP32. Option 3: Via Command-Line You will need to utilize a command-line tool to upload the firmware to your device from your local computer. Note this is not recommended unless you are using a platform other than Windows or Mac OSX, such as Linux. Install the latest Python 3.x utility based on your operating system: Windows: Download the installer from Python . When installing you may be prompted to \"Add Python to PATH\", and it is recommended to accept that option. Linux: Execute sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip MacOS: Execute brew install python using Homebrew ( instructions here ) From a terminal (command line) prompt run the following which will install the pip tool along with the esptool utility: python3 -m ensurepip python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools esptool Confirm that python was installed successfully by running the commands python --version and python3 --version . Use the command that reports a 3.x version ( python or python3 ) for all following steps. We will assume python3 is available. Navigate to the binaries/attenuator directory within the extracted GPStar-proton-pack software release: cd <extracted_location>/binaries/attenuator Run the following command to flash the bootloader and firmware: python3 -m esptool --port-filter vid=0x303A --chip esp32 --baud 921600 write-flash --flash-mode dio --flash-size detect --flash-freq 40m 0x1000 extras/Attenuator-Bootloader.bin 0x8000 extras/Attenuator-Partitions.bin 0xe000 extras/boot_app0.bin 0x10000 Attenuator.bin \ud83d\udcdd NOTE: If your device still cannot be found automatically you may need to view the \" USB Troubleshooting \" section at the bottom of this guide. ESP32: Standard Updates (via WiFi) This applies to all updates you will perform AFTER the first-time upload of the firmware for the device, when the private WiFi network for the Proton Pack is available via the custom firmware. Power up your Proton Pack and ESP32 device (whether standalone or as part of the Attenuator hardware). Open the WiFi preferences on your computer/device and look for the SSID which matches \"GPStar_Attenuator\" or begins \"ProtonPack_\" . If this is your first connection to this access point, use the default password \"555-2368\" . Navigate directly to the URL: http://192.168.1.2/update Use the \"Select File\" button and select the Attenuator.bin file from the /binaries/attenuator directory. The upload will begin immediately. Once at 100% the device will reboot. Navigate to http://192.168.1.2 or http://GPStar_Attenuator.local or http://protonpack_####.local to confirm that the device is able to communicate with the Proton Pack PCB. Note: If the upload fails, this is not uncommon. Simply attempt the upload again using the OTA updater. WiFi Security While every device gets a unique SSID for the wireless network, the password is always the same default of \"555-2368\". Therefore, to keep your device private and out of reach of others you are strongly encouraged to change this password. Setting a WiFi Password Since this device will make use of a private WiFi network with a default password, it is STRONGLY encouraged that you take a moment to change the password to something you prefer to avoid unauthorized access of your equipment. Once you are able to reach the web UI at http://192.168.1.2 or http://GPStar_Attenuator.local or http://ProtonPack_####.local scroll to the bottom of the page to find the \"Secure Device WiFi\" link. Follow the instructions on the page to set a new password for your device. This will be unique to the ESP32 controller and will persist as the new default even if the device is power-cycled. Passwords must only be at least 8 characters and you will be required to enter a matching password as confirmation to ensure you entered the expected string of characters. The password you choose will be stored in an area of the device's flash memory that is unaffected by future firmware updates. Therefore, if you forget your password you may need to load a special version of the firmware which can bypass that stored value and allow you to use the default password again. This process is covered in the next section. Forgot Your WiFi Password? The following is only applicable to users on firmware PRIOR to the v5.2.2 release. As of that release the ability to boot up with the default password was introduced by pressing down on the center dial when power is applied to the device. If you have forgotten the password to the private WiFi network, you will need to load a special firmware to allow you to access the device and reset the password. Though if you have opted to connect your device to a preferred WiFi network using the built-in WiFi settings, simply return to your device's IP address on that network and change the password for the private WiFi network as desired. In the case where you do not have access to your device via an external WiFi network, you will need to follow a special process using a USB cable and a utility for your OS of choice. This will follow the same process as the \"First-Time Upload\" instructions posted above, though you will instead load the Attenuator-Reset.bin file from the /binaries/attenuator directory. Once flashed, this will allow you to get back into the web UI at http://192.168.1.2 or http://protonpack_####.local using the default password (\"555-2368\") and change to your choice of password. Once changed, you will need to re-flash the device using the standard firmware--otherwise, the device will always use the default WiFi password while this firmware is loaded ! The new password will be used automatically to secure the WiFi access point once the regular firmware is in use. \ud83d\udcdd Note: When using this firmware there will be additional debug messages enabled for the device. Therefore, this firmware image may also be used to help debug WiFi issues by checking the output via the Arduino IDE's serial console. Be sure to set the baud rate to 115200 to view the output correctly. USB Troubleshooting Before beginning any actions when using a USB cable, be sure to use a high-quality USB cable which supports data transfer. Some cheap cables may only support charging (not data), or not fully support the power requirements of the device. Problem 1: Your ESP32 controller does not appear as a serial device in your operating system (COM# for Windows, /dev/cu.usb* for macOS/Linux). Solution 1: It is necessary to install a driver for the \"CP210x USB to UART Bridge\" onto your computer for some devices. A driver for Windows and macOS is available via Silicon Labs and has proved useful. Problem 2: The ESP32 device can be detected when using the ESPWebTool website but can't connect. Alternatively, you get a notice that the device must be reset. Solution 2: You must put the device into bootloader mode. To help with this, use the SerialTerminal website to connect to your device first: Plug ESP32 into computer Hold down BOOT button While holding BOOT, click EN once Continue holding BOOT until the firmware update tool says \"Connecting...\" then release You should see a message similar to the following which indicates the device is ready to flash: rst:0x1 (POWERON_RESET),boot:0x3 (DOWNLOAD_BOOT(UART0/UART1/SDIO_REI_REO_V2)) waiting for download Without disconnecting the device from your computer, and using the same browser tab, return to the ESPWebTool website](https://esp.huhn.me/) and complete the flashing process as described earlier in this guide as \"Option 2\". Note: If you get garbage on the screen when using the serial terminal, use the gear icon at the top right to make sure the baud rate is set to 115200. Problem 3: The process described in Solution 2 did not work, help! Solution 3: Try using Option 1 instead. For users not on Windows or Mac OSX, use Option 3 to run esptool manually. Problem 4: For Linux users, if you get a \"Permission denied\" error when running esptool you may need to add your user to the dialout group. Solution 4: Run this command, then log out and back in for the changes to take effect: `sudo usermod -aG dialout $USER` \ud83d\udcdd Tip: If you have successfully flashed your ESP32 device and do not see the available WiFi access point, try plugging your USB cable directly into the Talentcell battery or try another USB port on your computer. In rare cases the USB port and/or cable cannot supply enough voltage to run the ESP32's WiFi radio. \ud83d\udcdd Tip: To identify the USB device requires different methods based on the operating system used: For Linux use the lsusb utility (or lsusb -v ) to list attached USB devices. For MacOS run ls /dev/{tty,cu}.* to list available USB devices. For Windows , use the \"Device Manager\" and look at the \"Ports (COM & LPT)\" section.

Going forward, only the ESP32 will be supported for the Attenuator device, whether purchased as a kit from Frutto Technologies or as a DIY solution. The ESP32 microcontroller is capable of supporting Over-The-Air (OTA) updates for firmware, meaning you will need to utilize a desktop web browser from a computer (not a mobile device or tablet) and the built-in WiFi access point provided by the controller as \"GPStar_Attenuator\" (or with the prefix: \"ProtonPack_\" ). However, please note the following special conditions! If you used an off-the-shelf ESP32 device, then the software which enables the WiFi access point is not yet loaded so you will need to follow the \"First-Time Upload\" for the initial upload of firmware to your device. If you are performing your first upgrade to the version v6.x firmware, you will need to perform the exact same process as the \"First-Time Upload\" to re-partition your device to accept the larger firmware files.","title":"Flashing the Attenuator"},{"location":"ATTENUATOR_FLASHING/#important-upgrades-v5x-v6x","text":"\ud83d\uded1 STOP, PLEASE READ! The partition scheme for the ESP32-based controllers has changed as of v6.0.0 to support a larger firmware file. This requires an update via USB cable for any users who were previously on a firmware release in v5.x or earlier. You will need to follow the \"First-Time Upload\" process to use a new, custom partition scheme on the device which provides a larger storage areas for Over-the-Air (OTA) updates. The standard flash memory of the ESP-WROOM-32 modules we use is limited to 4MB and must provide space to upload new firmware. For context, the default partition prioritized a \"SPIFFS\" area which was intended for file storage but is not used for our purposes. By removing that storage area we can allocate more space for larger firmware images (app0/app1), and adds an additional area for non-volatile storage (NVS). Old Scheme: nvs: 20kb otadata: 8kb app0: 1280kb (ota_0) app1: 1280kb (ota_1) spiffs: 1408kb coredump: 64kb New Scheme: nvs: 20kb otadata: 8kb app0: 1920kb (ota_0) app1: 1920kb (ota_1) nvs2: 128kb coredump: 64kb Once you have updated to a firmware from v6.x or later using the USB process, then then you may proceed to using the instructions for over-the-air (OTA/WiFi) updates without a USB cable as described in the \"Standard Updates\" section. For a more visual representation, please refer to this flowchart:","title":"Important Upgrades: V5.x &rarr; V6.x"},{"location":"ATTENUATOR_FLASHING/#esp32-first-time-upload-via-usb","text":"The following steps MUST be taken if either of these situations applies to you: If you are using your own ESP32 controller direct from Amazon or another supplier, then the microcontroller has not been flashed with the GPStar firmware to enable the OTA upload feature and the manual flashing process is required. Or, if you are performing the first firmware update since the introduction of v6.x you will need to perform the manual flashing process. We need to make room for larger firmware files and this can only be done by repartitioning the device's internal 4MB storage area. If you encounter any issues while attempting to access your ESP32 device via a USB cable, please see the \" USB Troubleshooting \" section at the bottom of this guide. Option 1: Using GPStar ESP32 Firmware Uploader This uses a purpose-built flash tool just like the tools for the Proton Pack, Neutrona Wand, Single-Shot Blaster and GPStar Audio. Thanks to its ease of use, this is our recommended method for performing the first-time USB upload process. First, download either the Windows or Mac OSX flash tool from the extras folder. If you are on Linux, try Option 2 below instead. Windows: GPStar ESP32 Firmware Flasher MacOS Intel/M1: GPStar ESP32 Firmware Flasher (Mac OSX) Plug your device into a USB port on your computer. Locate the following files from the /binaries/attenuator directory. extras/Attenuator-Bootloader.bin = This is the standard bootloader for the ESP32 itself. extras/Attenuator-Partitions.bin = This specifies the partition scheme for the flash memory. extras/boot_app0.bin = This is the software for selecting the available/next OTA partition. Attenuator.bin = This is the custom firmware for the GPStar kit. Open the GPStar ESP32 Firmware Flasher and browse to the files specified in step 2 above for each of the four requested file locations (see below screenshot). The program should automatically detect the correct COM port and baud rate (see above screenshot). If it did not, use the drop-down menus to select the correct one for your PC. Click the Upload button to flash the new firmware to your ESP32. Be patient, this process can take between 15 seconds and several minutes depending on the selected baud rate. Once the flash has completed successfully, your ESP32 should now be broadcasting a WiFi network and you should be ready to install it into your Proton Pack. If the flash failed, please see Solution 2 in the \" USB Troubleshooting \" section at the bottom of this guide to manually switch the ESP32 into bootloader mode. You may also try lowering the baud rate to 115200 (if available), though note this will increase the time it takes to flash the firmware. Option 2: Via Web Uploader This uses a 3rd-party website to upload using the Web Serial protocol which is only available on the Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Opera desktop web browsers. Mobile browsers are NOT supported, and you will be prompted with a message if your web browser is not valid for use. Plug your device into a USB port on your computer and go to http://espwebtool.ghostbusters.engineering (which redirects to https://esp.huhn.me ). Locate the following files from the /binaries/attenuator directory. extras/Attenuator-Bootloader.bin = This is the standard bootloader for the ESP32 itself. extras/Attenuator-Partitions.bin = This specifies the partition scheme for the flash memory. extras/boot_app0.bin = This is the software for selecting the available/next OTA partition. Attenuator.bin = This is the custom firmware for the GPStar kit. Click on the CONNECT button and select your USB serial device from the list of options and click on \"Connect\". Once connected, select the files (noted above) for the following address spaces: 0x1000 \u2192 Attenuator-Bootloader.bin 0x8000 \u2192 Attenuator-Partitions.bin 0xE000 \u2192 boot_app0.bin 0x10000 \u2192 Attenuator.bin Click on the PROGRAM button to begin flashing. View the \"Output\" window to view progress of the flashing operation. Once the device has completely flashed (100%) unplug the USB cable and remove any remaining power source from the device. Restore power to reboot the device and confirm operation. View a quick video of what this process should look like. Your list of USB devices may differ, and it may require selecting a different device if you cannot immediately determine which connected device is your ESP32. Option 3: Via Command-Line You will need to utilize a command-line tool to upload the firmware to your device from your local computer. Note this is not recommended unless you are using a platform other than Windows or Mac OSX, such as Linux. Install the latest Python 3.x utility based on your operating system: Windows: Download the installer from Python . When installing you may be prompted to \"Add Python to PATH\", and it is recommended to accept that option. Linux: Execute sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip MacOS: Execute brew install python using Homebrew ( instructions here ) From a terminal (command line) prompt run the following which will install the pip tool along with the esptool utility: python3 -m ensurepip python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools esptool Confirm that python was installed successfully by running the commands python --version and python3 --version . Use the command that reports a 3.x version ( python or python3 ) for all following steps. We will assume python3 is available. Navigate to the binaries/attenuator directory within the extracted GPStar-proton-pack software release: cd <extracted_location>/binaries/attenuator Run the following command to flash the bootloader and firmware: python3 -m esptool --port-filter vid=0x303A --chip esp32 --baud 921600 write-flash --flash-mode dio --flash-size detect --flash-freq 40m 0x1000 extras/Attenuator-Bootloader.bin 0x8000 extras/Attenuator-Partitions.bin 0xe000 extras/boot_app0.bin 0x10000 Attenuator.bin \ud83d\udcdd NOTE: If your device still cannot be found automatically you may need to view the \" USB Troubleshooting \" section at the bottom of this guide.","title":"ESP32: First-Time Upload (via USB)"},{"location":"ATTENUATOR_FLASHING/#esp32-standard-updates-via-wifi","text":"This applies to all updates you will perform AFTER the first-time upload of the firmware for the device, when the private WiFi network for the Proton Pack is available via the custom firmware.

Passwords must only be at least 8 characters and you will be required to enter a matching password as confirmation to ensure you entered the expected string of characters. The password you choose will be stored in an area of the device's flash memory that is unaffected by future firmware updates.

The only means of accessing this is to remove the barrel release assembly and a portion of the plastic base which sits below the stock controller board. This may require some cutting as the center of that piece is glued directly to the wand handle. Once removed, access to the old bargraph is quite easy and takes removal of 2 screws. The circuit board with the LEDs resides under a small black cover and can be removed from the wand once that cover is removed. To install the bargraph, you will want to remove and cut the clear plastic piece away and the original barrel wire cover plastic. You can fit the bargraph into the 3 piece system available on this repository or purchase from the gpstartechnologies.com There is an alternative mounting solution using the one piece mount. It should fit the bargraph tightly while also slotting into the clear plastic. Also available to download in this repository, or purchase from the gpstartechnologies.com website are 2 versions (short or long depending on how much plastic you remove) of a barrel wire cover, to protect your wires from getting caught on the retractable wand barrel mechanism. This cover screws onto the existing holes that the previous Hasbro board was screwed into, making it easy to remove and to do service inside your wand.

The only means of accessing this is to remove the barrel release assembly and a portion of the plastic base which sits below the stock controller board. This may require some cutting as the center of that piece is glued directly to the wand handle. Once removed, access to the old bargraph is quite easy and takes removal of 2 screws. The circuit board with the LEDs resides under a small black cover and can be removed from the wand once that cover is removed. To install the bargraph, you will want to remove and cut the clear plastic piece away and the original barrel wire cover plastic. You can fit the bargraph into the 3 piece system available on this repository or purchase from the gpstartechnologies.com There is an alternative mounting solution using the one piece mount. It should fit the bargraph tightly while also slotting into the clear plastic. Also available to download in this repository, or purchase from the gpstartechnologies.com website are 2 versions (short or long depending on how much plastic you remove) of a barrel wire cover, to protect your wires from getting caught on the retractable wand barrel mechanism. This cover screws onto the existing holes that the previous Hasbro board was screwed into, making it easy to remove and to do service inside your wand.","title":"Hasbro Bargraph Fitment &amp; Installation"},{"location":"BARGRAPH/#diy-28-segment-bargraph","text":"Additional parts will be required, as well as a more invasive disassembling of the wand.

This guide shows how to an interactive light show to any such device produced by the community, with some light modifications. This depends on the presence of an Attenuator or WiFi Adapter in order to provide a wireless integration with your equipment. Watch this demonstration of the Belt Gizmo and Stream Effects devices: Your browser does not support the video tag. External Shell Many models of this device exist in the wild and you can pick any that you prefer as your base. Or if you have an existing Belt Gizmo you may be able to modify it to incorporate the new electronics. Belt Gizmo by Dave W Belt Gizmo by MRKIOU Belt Gizmo Back by Dustin Grau Bill of Materials Assembly of this device WILL require SOLDERING skills and is considered a DIY approach at this time. The exact list of parts below were chosen for their availability from common sources and/or available support across the Internet. Addressable 5V WS2812B Fairy String Lights Waveshare ESP32-S3-Zero Mini Dev Board USB-C 5V Boost Converter and Lithium Battery Charger 2500mAh 3.7V Lithium Polymer Battery Pack SPDT 2-Position Micro Slide Switch SPST Momentary Push Button Switch 28AWG Stranded Silicone Hookup Wire 270 ohm Resisitor ESP32 - Pin Connections The following is a diagram of the ESP32-S3-Zero pins from left and right, when oriented with the USB connection facing up (north) like the pinout diagram above-top. We only need a single !! IMPORTANT !! This diagram is based on the dev module recommended in the links above. If your device differs there will likely be position or label changes. Connection ESP32 (L) ESP32 (R) Connection USB to 5V-OUT + 5V TX to 5V-OUT - GND RX 3V3(OUT) GP13 GP1 GP12 GP2 GP11 GP2 GP10 to LEDs GP4 GP9 GP5 GP8 GP6 GP7 Power - Pin Connections We need to both power the device but also allow for the battery pack to be charged without removing it from the Belt Gizmo every time. This approach uses a slide switch to cut power to the ESP32 and allows for faster charging without simultaneously draining the battery. We also make use of the Key switch to turn the power on or off. A single press will turn on the boost chip while two quick presses will turn it off. For the battery you have 2 options: use a JST socket to connect your battery or cut off the existing plug. The latter may be quicker if you are comfortable with re-soldering a new battery in the future should the current one no longer hold a charge. Carefully cut off the plug from the LiPo battery pack, cutting each wire 1 AT TIME to avoid a short-circuit. You will connect battery leads to the through-hole connections opposite the battery: positive (red) to + and negative (black) to - as expected. From the 5V through-hole ports you are best to solder a single wire to each due to the diameter of the holes. Use red for the + connection and - for negative, using 2-3\" of wire for each. We will use these as a pigtail connection to connect our devices which need 5V power: 5V + Connects to LED positive and ESP32 5V via SPDT Slide Switch 5V - Connects to LED negative and ESP32 GND The hole labelled K connects to one side of the SPST Momentary Switch, the other side to the 5V - wire used above. Note: You will not need the USB2 connector supplied with this device. Assembly The LEDs chosen for this project are the same which may be used with the Proton Pack when adding the sparking effect to your inner cyclotron cake. Essentially this used a spare segment of 8 addressable LEDs which fit within the 7 nixie tubes and the E block. Note that the 270 ohm resistor will be used on the data line which connects to pin GP4 of the ESP32. The STL file stl/misc/belt_gizmo_back.stl is available in this project as a holder for the electronics and is highly recommended to keep things clean and compact. This should work with most Belt Gizmo designs, though it was created specifically for the MRKIOU (Q) design linked above. The excess wiring for each LED can be carefully folded over and secured behind each light in the nixie tubes. The sequence of lights begins with the E block and moves left from there. Lengths of the silicone wiring can be used to provide more visual interest to the base of each nixie tube and terminate on the backside of the gizmo itself. You can see the ends of the wires secured with hot glue in the next photo. Not shown here is the mini slide switch which severs power to the ESP32 so that the device can be charged without simultaneously discharging. Firmware Flashing Option 1: Using GPStar ESP32 Firmware Uploader This uses a purpose-built flash tool just like the tools for the Proton Pack, Neutrona Wand, Single-Shot Blaster and GPStar Audio. Thanks to its ease of use, this is our recommended method for performing the first-time USB upload process. First, download either the Windows or Mac OSX flash tool from the extras folder. If you are on Linux, try Option 2 below instead. Windows: GPStar ESP32 Firmware Flasher MacOS Intel/M1: GPStar ESP32 Firmware Flasher (Mac OSX) Plug your device into a USB port on your computer. Locate the following files from the /binaries/gizmo directory. extras/BeltGizmo-Bootloader.bin = This is the standard bootloader for the ESP32 itself. extras/BeltGizmo-Partitions.bin = This specifies the partition scheme for the flash memory. extras/boot_app0.bin = This is the software for selecting the available/next OTA partition. BeltGizmo.bin = This is the custom firmware for the GPStar kit. Open the GPStar ESP32 Firmware Flasher and browse to the files specified in step 2 above for each of the four requested file locations (see below screenshot). The program should automatically detect the correct COM port and baud rate (see above screenshot). If it did not, use the drop-down menus to select the correct one for your PC. Click the Upload button to flash the new firmware to your ESP32. Be patient, this process can take between 15 seconds and several minutes depending on the selected baud rate. Once the flash has completed successfully, your ESP32 should now be broadcasting a WiFi network. If the flash failed, please see Solution 2 in the \" USB Troubleshooting \" section at the bottom of this guide to manually switch the ESP32 into bootloader mode. You may also try lowering the baud rate to 115200 (if available), though note this will increase the time it takes to flash the firmware. Option 2: Via Web Uploader This uses a 3rd-party website to upload using the Web Serial protocol which is only available on the Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Opera desktop web browsers. Mobile browsers are NOT supported, and you will be prompted with a message if your web browser is not valid for use. Plug your device into a USB port on your computer and go to http://espwebtool.ghostbusters.engineering (which redirects to https://esp.huhn.me ). Locate the following files from the /binaries/gizmo directory. extras/BeltGizmo-Bootloader.bin = This is the standard bootloader for the ESP32 itself. extras/BeltGizmo-Partitions.bin = This specifies the partition scheme for the flash memory. extras/boot_app0.bin = This is the software for selecting the available/next OTA partition. BeltGizmo.bin = This is the custom firmware for the GPStar kit. Click on the CONNECT button and select your USB serial device from the list of options and click on \"Connect\". Once connected, select the files (noted above) for the following address spaces: 0x0000 \u2192 BeltGizmo-Bootloader.bin 0x8000 \u2192 BeltGizmo-Partitions.bin 0xE000 \u2192 boot_app0.bin 0x10000 \u2192 BeltGizmo.bin Click on the PROGRAM button to begin flashing. View the \"Output\" window to view progress of the flashing operation. Once the device has completely flashed (100%) unplug the USB cable and remove any remaining power source from the device. Restore power to reboot the device and confirm operation. View a quick video of what this process should look like. Your list of USB devices may differ, and it may require selecting a different device if you cannot immediately determine which connected device is your ESP32. Option 3: Via Command-Line You will need to utilize a command-line tool to upload the firmware to your device from your local computer. Note this is not recommended unless you are using a platform other than Windows or Mac OSX, such as Linux. Install the latest Python 3.x utility based on your operating system: Windows: Download the installer from Python . When installing you may be prompted to \"Add Python to PATH\", and it is recommended to accept that option. Linux: Execute sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip MacOS: Execute brew install python using Homebrew ( instructions here ) From a terminal (command line) prompt run the following which will install the pip tool along with the esptool utility: python3 -m ensurepip python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools esptool Confirm that python was installed successfully by running the commands python --version and python3 --version . Use the command that reports a 3.x version ( python or python3 ) for all following steps. We will assume python3 is available. Navigate to the binaries/gizmo directory within the extracted GPStar-proton-pack software release: cd <extracted_location>/binaries/gizmo Run the following command to flash the bootloader and firmware: python3 -m esptool --port-filter vid=0x303A --chip esp32s3 --baud 921600 write-flash --flash-mode dio --flash-size detect --flash-freq 80m 0x0 extras/BeltGizmo-Bootloader.bin 0x8000 extras/BeltGizmo-Partitions.bin 0xe000 extras/boot_app0.bin 0x10000 BeltGizmo.bin \ud83d\udcdd NOTE: If your device still cannot be found automatically you may need to view the \" USB Troubleshooting \" section at the bottom of this guide. ESP32: Standard Updates (via WiFi) This applies to all updates you will perform AFTER the first-time upload of the firmware for the device, when the private WiFi network for the Proton Pack is available via the custom firmware. Power on the Belt Gizmo. Open the WiFi preferences on your computer/device and look for the SSID which matches \"GPStar_BeltGizmo\" or begins \"ProtonPack_\" . If this is your first connection to this access point, use the default password \"555-2368\" . Navigate directly to the URL: http://192.168.1.2/update Use the \"Select File\" button and select the BeltGizmo.bin file from the /binaries/gizmo directory. The upload will begin immediately. Once at 100% the device will reboot. Navigate to http://192.168.1.2 or http://BeltGizmo_####.local to confirm that the device is able to communicate with the Proton Pack PCB. Note: If the upload fails, this is not uncommon. Simply attempt the upload again using the OTA updater. Operation Look for a WiFi network of \"BeltGizmo_0000\" or similar and connect using the password 555-2368 . Open a web browser to the same name as the network name, for instance http://BeltGizmo_0000.local . Security Notice This device uses a default password of 555-2368 and should be changed immediately. You also have the option of changing the SSID broadcast if desired. USB Troubleshooting Before beginning any actions when using a USB cable, be sure to use a high-quality USB cable which supports data transfer. Some cheap cables may only support charging (not data), or not fully support the power requirements of the device. Problem 1: Your ESP32 controller does not appear as a serial device in your operating system (COM# for Windows, /dev/cu.usb* for macOS/Linux). Solution 1: It may be necessary to install a driver for the \"ESP32-S3 USB-CDC JTAG Interface\" onto your computer. A driver for Windows is available via GitHub . Problem 2: The ESP32 device can be detected when using the ESPWebTool website but can't connect. Alternatively, you get a notice that the device must be reset. Solution 2: You must put the device into bootloader mode. To help with this, use the SerialTerminal website to connect to your device first: Hold down BOOT button and EN button. Plug ESP32 into computer While holding EN, release the BOOT button. Once you hear the connection sound from your computer, release the BOOT button. You should see a message similar to the following which indicates the device is ready to flash: rst:0x1 (POWERON_RESET),boot:0x3 (DOWNLOAD_BOOT(UART0/UART1/SDIO_REI_REO_V2)) waiting for download Without disconnecting the device from your computer, and using the same browser tab, return to the ESPWebTool website](https://esp.huhn.me/) and complete the flashing process as described earlier in this guide as \"Option 2\". Note: If you get garbage on the screen when using the serial terminal, use the gear icon at the top right to make sure the baud rate is set to 115200. Problem 3: The process described in Solution 2 did not work, help! Solution 3: Try using Option 1 instead. For users not on Windows or Mac OSX, use Option 3 to run esptool manually. Problem 4: For Linux users, if you get a \"Permission denied\" error when running esptool you may need to add your user to the dialout group. Solution 4: Run this command, then log out and back in for the changes to take effect: `sudo usermod -aG dialout $USER` \ud83d\udcdd Tip: If you have successfully flashed your ESP32 device and do not see the available WiFi access point, try plugging your USB cable directly into the Talentcell battery or try another USB port on your computer. In rare cases the USB port and/or cable cannot supply enough voltage to run the ESP32's WiFi radio. \ud83d\udcdd Tip: To identify the USB device requires different methods based on the operating system used: For Linux use the lsusb utility (or lsusb -v ) to list attached USB devices. For MacOS run ls /dev/{tty,cu}.* to list available USB devices. For Windows , use the \"Device Manager\" and look at the \"Ports (COM & LPT)\" section. These guides from Espressif may be of some help as a reference: Espressif - esptool Installation Espressif - Flashing Firmware Espressif - Boot Mode Selection Software Development Requirements As of the v6.0.0 release the development platform of choice for this device has been migrated from Arduino IDE to the VSCode with PlatformIO . Please follow the linked guide for installing the core software and plugins required.","title":"Belt Gizmo"},{"location":"BELT_GIZMO/#belt-gizmo","text":"While the original \"gizmo\" was never given an on-screen purpose it has endured as a standard piece of kit for any uniform.

Problem 1: Your ESP32 controller does not appear as a serial device in your operating system (COM# for Windows, /dev/cu.usb* for macOS/Linux). Solution 1: It may be necessary to install a driver for the \"ESP32-S3 USB-CDC JTAG Interface\" onto your computer. A driver for Windows is available via GitHub . Problem 2: The ESP32 device can be detected when using the ESPWebTool website but can't connect. Alternatively, you get a notice that the device must be reset. Solution 2: You must put the device into bootloader mode. To help with this, use the SerialTerminal website to connect to your device first: Hold down BOOT button and EN button. Plug ESP32 into computer While holding EN, release the BOOT button. Once you hear the connection sound from your computer, release the BOOT button. You should see a message similar to the following which indicates the device is ready to flash: rst:0x1 (POWERON_RESET),boot:0x3 (DOWNLOAD_BOOT(UART0/UART1/SDIO_REI_REO_V2)) waiting for download Without disconnecting the device from your computer, and using the same browser tab, return to the ESPWebTool website](https://esp.huhn.me/) and complete the flashing process as described earlier in this guide as \"Option 2\". Note: If you get garbage on the screen when using the serial terminal, use the gear icon at the top right to make sure the baud rate is set to 115200. Problem 3: The process described in Solution 2 did not work, help! Solution 3: Try using Option 1 instead. For users not on Windows or Mac OSX, use Option 3 to run esptool manually. Problem 4: For Linux users, if you get a \"Permission denied\" error when running esptool you may need to add your user to the dialout group. Solution 4: Run this command, then log out and back in for the changes to take effect: `sudo usermod -aG dialout $USER` \ud83d\udcdd Tip: If you have successfully flashed your ESP32 device and do not see the available WiFi access point, try plugging your USB cable directly into the Talentcell battery or try another USB port on your computer. In rare cases the USB port and/or cable cannot supply enough voltage to run the ESP32's WiFi radio. \ud83d\udcdd Tip: To identify the USB device requires different methods based on the operating system used: For Linux use the lsusb utility (or lsusb -v ) to list attached USB devices. For MacOS run ls /dev/{tty,cu}.* to list available USB devices. For Windows , use the \"Device Manager\" and look at the \"Ports (COM & LPT)\" section.

There are currently 2 options available for upgrade, using standard LEDs or an LED panel. The latter is the more user-friendly and preferred option as it brings RGB functionality that allows displaying a more broad range of effects. Note that when in the Frozen Empire theme and using the Proton Stream, the inner panel and cyclotron lights will NOT be illuminated. This mimics the state of Phoebes' \"Brass Pack\" when fighting Garrakka. In this state only the sparking lights (covered below) will be visibly illuminated. Option 1: Standard LEDs There is a included STL file that you can 3D Print to replace the Cyclotron switch plate. You can add 5mm LEDs into the holes. See reference in the Pack Setup (PCB) for connections or Pack Setup (DIY) for wiring to the Arduino Mega. You can use cliplites to hold the LEDs in place. Refer to the full DIY parts list on where to source them. Option 2: LED Panel Supported as an alternative to regular LEDs is the GPStar Cyclotron LED Panel and or Frutto Technology Cyclotron LED panel. These panels will change colours depending on the state of your Proton Pack system. You will want to substitute 8 clear CLF-280-CTP cliplites . This panel will sit between the pack controller and the inner cyclotron \"cake\" lights.

The inner ring you can use smaller m3x8 hex screws for decoration. Enlarge or drill any holes for wire decoration or feeding wires into the Cyclotron as necessary. Sparking Cyclotron Lights (Optional) For the effect seen in the Frozen Empire movie, it is possible to extend the LEDs beyond the end of the NeoPixel ring used within the inner cyclotron and run them inside the cavity between the \"cake\" and the copper blocks. These addressable \"fairy lights\" have been used successfully for the effect. They use an enamel-coated copper wire which makes them unobtrusive and they don't stand out like LED strips.

Overview The stock lights in the HasLab pack only supplies 12 addressable LEDs which are red-only. If you wish to be able to change the colours of these lights you will need to replace them with an addressable LED ring, GPStar Cyclotron LEDs or those made by Frutto Technology such as the 20-LED (4x 5-LED) or 36-LED (4x 9-LED) option. Regardless of solution you will need to split apart the Cyclotron Lid which is secured at 6 locations around the lid. Gently prying under the plastic near the N-Filter on the inside of the lid will be the first screw posts cold-welded to the lid. A firm but slow twist should break the bond and begin to separate the halves. To re-secure, the best option is to drill through the center of each obvious cold weld on the inner lid and use small screws to attach the halves back together. Haslab Proton Pack Hookup Guide DIY and Spirit Packs Hookup Guide Installation Guide Video GPStar Proton Pack & Neutrona Wand Cyclotron Lights Installation Video (YouTube) The stock LEDs can be removed by prying out the diffuser lenses, then snipping the 3 black plastic welds used to hold the PCBs in place. Whether pre-soldered or not, the new LEDs should be oriented similar to the arcing pattern used by the stock LEDs. Hot glue can be used to keep these in place until the diffusers are put back in place. Note: Installation is the same for the 5-LED or 9-LED replacement kits from Frutto Technology. When replacing the diffuser lenses, keep wires tucked into the available slots to avoid pinching. Secure all wires to avoid them from moving after installation. The new LEDs will need to be selected via the EEPROM setup menu #4. Select the 20-LED option for the correct count and speed defaults. Reassemble the Cyclotron Lid using low-profile machine screws. The new LEDs should not need additional diffusion unless that is your preference. Installation Video (YouTube) 40-LED Neopixel Ring (Deprecated) This approach simply adds the lights atop the old circuit board and LEDs between the outer and inner layers of the Cyclotron Lid. Print the Cyclotron Ring Diffuser to help orient the ring and keep it positioned behind each lens. The pixel opposite the soldered connections should be number 1 and should be made the dead center of the top-right lens. See below for an illustration of this orientation and use of the diffuser ring. For the electrical connections, this reuses 3/4 the available connections on the lid (the pogo pins) for 5V power (red), data (yellow), and ground (black). You will remove those connections and solder new wires to the circuit board on the lid to connect to the ring. It is important to leave the brown wire attached as this triggers the lid removal detection. To improve the fit of the new ring, it is recommended to use a Dremel with a sanding drum to remove any raised plastic bits which are below the ring. Also note that the added materials will not allow the inner and outer shells to fit as tightly. Applying some black foam weatherstripping to the edge of the outer shell will help hide any gaps but also provide some material to push back against the inner shell when screwing the halves together.

Bill of Materials Power Requirements Compiling and Uploading the Code GPStar Audio PCB or WAV Trigger Configuration Loading The Audio Files Audio Output Guide DIY Pack Setup - Arduino Mega 2560 R3 DIY Wand Setup - Mega 2560 Pro Mini Hose Connections","title":"Legacy DIY"},{"location":"DIY_PACK/","text":"Proton Pack Setup This guide begins with some explanations for common items you will encounter during the upgrade process. Note that if the wand electronics will be replaced it will be necessary to upgrade the hose and conductors between the pack and wand. This exercise is left to individual preferences on connectors and style of replacement, though you will need 4 conductors at a minimum (+5V, Ground, and TX/RX for communications). Component Reference A Note on Transistors Transistors will be used to allow switching high-current elements on or off. This is because the Arduino hardware recommends less than 20mA draw per pin (40mA maximum), so for items which may require more power the transistor acts as a switch to allow more current to flow through the transistor instead of the Arduino hardware. The most-used component for this build will be the 2N2222/PN2222 or NPN Bipolar Transistor (BJT). The NPN type allows the flow of power from the Collector to Emitter pin, dictated by applying power (VCC) to the Base pin. Pin Description NPN E Emitter NPN B Base NPN C Collector A Note on the Rotary Encoder Rotary encoder pin layout reference to be used for volume control. Contains pins 1-2-3 (viewed facing you, see below). HasLab Legacy Connections This chart lists only the components in the stock pack which will be reused, while others will be replaced (such as the speaker output and rotary encoder which are both soldered to the stock controller). There are several new and optional components which can be added as part of this guide. These items are expected to be implemented at a minimum for basic operation. Connector Label Header Color Wire Color Purpose Notes M1 Green Red VCC Pack vibration motor; cannot be turned on or off when pack is \"active\", only when in \"powered down\" state. (This is the only stock item which may be considered optional.) Black GND JP3 White Green B0 Power, ground, and data (DI) for Power Cell LEDs; Contains LEDs D1-D13 and returns data signal back to board via the B0 pin. Black GND Yellow DI Data input; Cyclotron LEDs continue from B0 as data on RI (unplugging JP3 will stop cycling of Cyclotron LEDs). Red VCC JP4 Red Red VCC Power, ground, and data (RI) for Cyclotron; Each \"lens\" contains 3 LEDs for a total of 12. Yellow RI Data input; starts on JP3-DI pin and continues from JP3-B0 Black GND Brown GND Used for detection of the Cyclotron Lid SW1 White Red VCC Main \"power\" switch under the Ion Arm, enables all pack operations. Black GND SW3 Blue Green SPDT Toggle Left toggle switch inside the Cyclotron: Turns rumble motor on (up) or off (down) Blue SW4 Green SPDT Toggle Right toggle switch inside the Cyclotron: Change sound theme between Afterlife (up) or 1984 (down) Red SW6 Red Red VCC Sensor on the Cyclotron cable, triggers alarm beeps when disconnected Black GND Circuit Schematic You may choose one of two routes for implementing the new Proton Pack controller: A minimal approach which only focuses on reusing the stock connections and hardware (switches, LEDs, motor). It is possible to forego replacing the microcontroller in the Hasbro wand and simply use a stock wand. This approach will provide power to the wand but no interactivity between the wand and the pack. Using all stock hardware as above, but with room for additional features, each of which is considered optional. This will provide full interaction with the new controller for the Neutrona Wand. Prototyping and Connections Use a half size protoboard like ( 1609 Adafruit ) or by any other brand. These work similar to a breadboard, where LETTERED columns run horizontal and are connected as a group, and each side contains 2 rails for (+) and (-) connections and run vertically along the board, also connected together. Connections from stock JST-XH connectors may be split to maximize use of the smallest protoboard possible. This is a non-reversible change and removes the ability to swap components without de-soldering wires. This is your last caution before proceeding!

(see below for more info) SMOKE2 This is a standard 5V Air/Vacuum pump motor I use. (see below for more info) Regarding the smoke effects, I am using eroll mac joytech vape pen . I hook up with tubing the mini pump which is linked in the parts list . One end of the pump creates suction and sucks the smoke in, and the other end of the pump pushes the smoke out. The vape pen itself is activating when suction is applied by the motor. The vape pens are battery powered but come with a USB cable for charging, so I can feed it 5V with a USB cable directly to the pen and not have to rely on the battery it has in it. View the Smoke Kit Guide for more information on optional smoke effects. When the pump is controlled with the transistor/diode setup as in the diagrams, it is the only device which draws power from the 5V rail. CAUTION: If you implement your own smoke solution using a different design, test your setup independent of the described circuit and with adequate measurement tools to ensure you will not draw power through the Arduino! Most designs which use a vape pen (cartomizer) and mini air pump require ~3.6V to run correctly, and while less than the 5V supplied to the circuit below some solutions can require nearly 1 Amp of current to run these devices together. This can also overwhelm the 2N2222 transistor used in this schematic. By comparison, the current required for a small fan or the vibration motor are perfectly fine for the transistors as described, while the diodes prevent any backflow of current when those devices power down (but may still spin briefly).

It is better to place this as close as possible to the component rather than on PCB when possible. Positive Capacitor Negative JP3 ( Red ) CAP 100uf JP3 (Black) JP4 ( Red ) CAP 100uf JP4 (Black) NEO-CYC (+) CAP 100uf NEO-CYC (-) Protoboard Diagram Reference and Interpretations: When you see a letter or code in a cells above, it references where component needs to be inserted or what needs to be connected there. Reference the photos below for more information. Letters should be connected together by a length of wire. These are jumper wires to provide power or ground connections to a specific row of connections on the board. They do not indicate a specific space to make the connection. Each letter should have a (+) or (-) designation to help identify it as +5V or Ground. Example #1: You see \"Z+\" in space \"+1\" (Column \"+\", Row 1) on the breadboard and again on \"B1\" (Column \"B\", Row 1). You need to connect a wire to these 2 points. In this case, the result is positive power on the \"+\" rail being delivered into all of row 1 for any connections in columns A through E. Example #2: In space \"-1\" you have a connection \"Y-\" and you need to run a wire from \"-1\" to \"F1\" on the right side of the breadboard. This will deliver ground from the \"-\" rail to columns F through J on row 1. Components will be connected in multiple adjacent spaces. Components will span rows or across the mid-gap in the board to allow one or more connections at each end. Note the arrows which will indicate the orientation (vertical or horizontal) for these items and which spaces they will span. Connections to the board will only be noted in designated spots. Example #1: In E8 is one end of a 470ohm resistor. You need to put the other end of this resistor onto F8 on the board. Resistors do not have polarity and so either end can be placed into either of the marked spaces. Example #2: In H16 is one end of a 1N4001 diode. You need to then put the STRIPED end of the diode to H13 on the board as indicated with the (s). Diodes have a polarity which affects the flow of current, so pay close attention to these markings. Example #3: In C29 is one end of a 330ohm resistor, and the other end runs vertically to C26. This is indicated by the \u2195 which shows the direction of the component. The symbol \u2194 here is used to show an item is oriented horizontally. Spaces leading with \"PIN\" indicates an Arduino connection. A length of wire (to be determined by the placement of the final switch, LED, or other component) must be soldered to the board at the designated spot and connected to the Arduino Mega at the noted pin. Example #1: G8 says PIN 53. You need to run a wire from this point to PIN 53 to the Arduino Mega. (See chart below protoboard photo.) Additional Connections to the Arduino MEGA These are connections which are not covered in the diagram above and can connect directly to the Arduino board. For the WAV Trigger these are the same connections which are used for the FTDI breakout board to program the WAV Trigger.

Use a transistor setup if you need more power. N-Filter LED \u2192 Pin 46 Optional Feature (not shown in schematic) Goes 5V high, is timed to go off at the same time as SMOKE-1 and SMOKE-2. This can be used for another optional LED for the N-Filter during overheat or sustained firing. If you attach a LED to this pin, use the appropriate resistor required for the LED. WARNING: DO NOT DRAW MORE THAN 40ma FROM A PIN. Use a transistor setup if you need more power. Cyclotron Panel LEDs NOTE: If you change LED colours, use an appropriate resistor based on the forward voltage stated for the LED. The resistors referenced here are the minimum required for these particular 5mm LED diodes. You can always go up to the nearest resistor value if you do not have the specified value. For example you may use 150 if do not have any 140\u2019s in your resistor kit, and 100 instead of 90s. Most resistors are expected to be within 5% of their stated value.

Cyclotron Lights N-Filter Vent Light Component Fitment Given the large spaces and \"compartments\" within the pack, finding a place for the protoboard, Arduino, WAV Trigger, audio amplifier, and battery should be no problem. Reusing the space from the old controller is ideal for the protoboard and Arduino. Most modders have found that the removal of the case for a Talencell battery allows it to fit under the original battery compartment--just use care that the sides of the batteries are covered with electrical tape and nothing can accidentally damage or short the components which may be exposed. Additionally, it's worth covering the bottom contacts on any circuit boards which are in close proximity to each other just in case shifting occurs while wearing the pack.

This is because the Arduino hardware recommends less than 20mA draw per pin (40mA maximum), so for items which may require more power the transistor acts as a switch to allow more current to flow through the transistor instead of the Arduino hardware. The most-used component for this build will be the 2N2222/PN2222 or NPN Bipolar Transistor (BJT). The NPN type allows the flow of power from the Collector to Emitter pin, dictated by applying power (VCC) to the Base pin.

It is possible to forego replacing the microcontroller in the Hasbro wand and simply use a stock wand. This approach will provide power to the wand but no interactivity between the wand and the pack. Using all stock hardware as above, but with room for additional features, each of which is considered optional. This will provide full interaction with the new controller for the Neutrona Wand. Prototyping and Connections Use a half size protoboard like ( 1609 Adafruit ) or by any other brand. These work similar to a breadboard, where LETTERED columns run horizontal and are connected as a group, and each side contains 2 rails for (+) and (-) connections and run vertically along the board, also connected together. Connections from stock JST-XH connectors may be split to maximize use of the smallest protoboard possible. This is a non-reversible change and removes the ability to swap components without de-soldering wires. This is your last caution before proceeding!

(see below for more info) SMOKE2 This is a standard 5V Air/Vacuum pump motor I use. (see below for more info) Regarding the smoke effects, I am using eroll mac joytech vape pen . I hook up with tubing the mini pump which is linked in the parts list . One end of the pump creates suction and sucks the smoke in, and the other end of the pump pushes the smoke out. The vape pen itself is activating when suction is applied by the motor. The vape pens are battery powered but come with a USB cable for charging, so I can feed it 5V with a USB cable directly to the pen and not have to rely on the battery it has in it. View the Smoke Kit Guide for more information on optional smoke effects. When the pump is controlled with the transistor/diode setup as in the diagrams, it is the only device which draws power from the 5V rail. CAUTION: If you implement your own smoke solution using a different design, test your setup independent of the described circuit and with adequate measurement tools to ensure you will not draw power through the Arduino! Most designs which use a vape pen (cartomizer) and mini air pump require ~3.6V to run correctly, and while less than the 5V supplied to the circuit below some solutions can require nearly 1 Amp of current to run these devices together. This can also overwhelm the 2N2222 transistor used in this schematic. By comparison, the current required for a small fan or the vibration motor are perfectly fine for the transistors as described, while the diodes prevent any backflow of current when those devices power down (but may still spin briefly).

Due to memory limitations of this device no further software updates are possible. In order to make use of this guide you will need to upgrade to either an official GPStar Neutrona Wand controller PCB or use a Mega2560 Pro Mini as linked in the DIY_BOM document. This guide begins with some explanations for common items you will encounter during the upgrade process. Note that it will be necessary to upgrade the hose and conductors between the pack and wand. This exercise is left to individual preferences on connectors and style of replacement, though you will need 4 conductors at a minimum (+5V, Ground, and TX/RX for communications). The space within the Neutrona Wand is extremely limited, though multiple components must be fit into this space. To maximize what is available, some wires from the original controller (PCB) can be directly soldered onto the microcontroller. Where resistors or inline components are required, these may be soldered between the wire and microcontroller to reduce need for an additional protoboard. If needed, a a \u00bc protoboard from Adafruit or any similar size from another manufacturer will be used. Special Cautions and Warnings You will find that the wand poses some challenges due to confined spaces and fragile wires to all the stock components. The following are suggestions to help you minimize damage to existing wiring, unless you plan to remove all the stock components and connect new wires. Remove what you can of any plastic covers over the switches internally, and use a hot glue gun to carefully drip glue over the soldered ends of the toggles, rotary encoder, and any other wire connections to reinforce them as they stand. Gently separate any wires that are bonded together, allowing about 1\" of excess for stripping. Use a mechanical wire stripper to ensure you quickly strip back the sheathing for each wire. Use silicone-coated stranded wiring (22AWG down to 26AWG) to allow for maximum flexibility. Solder on extensions to every wire in the wand and use heat-shrink tubing to reinforce extended connections to make a better bond with the stock wire to prevent breakage. Continue the extended wire to either a PCB or the microcontroller for soldering, making sure that ALL of the strands of wire make it through the holes. Twist your bare wires tightly, and you can pre-tin the ends with a bit of solder to keep everything together as you fit the wire through any PCB holes (this also works well for making breadboard connections). Optionally, this is where you may consider a full replacement of some wires if they break off at the component you are connecting. It's too easy to have some strands that get missed which could cause a short--check your connections after soldering. A magnifying glass and good lighting is your friend!

Creative placement of any protoboards, the Arduino, WAV Trigger, and speaker (if upgraded) will be left to each individual. As a matter of advice, placing the WAV Trigger under the wand barrel is an advised option with other items \"stacked\" above and beside the spring-loaded mechanism. (See the alternate component fitment section below for more information on the stacking option) For another fitment option, the WAV Trigger can also fit in the opposite half of the gun box if the barrel jack is removed--this is to avoid the spring which attaches to the wand barrel. (See the Audio Output addendum for more information on the opposite half gun box mounting solution) Audio Output Addendum Below is a view of the wand internals showing the microcontroller, a PCB for connections, and many of the wires which extend the stock wiring. This solution is using several of the included STL files: a small spacer is meant to fit under the barrel if you removed some of the plastic from the old controller mount; another 3D printed part is meant to protect the wiring from intruding on the barrel latching mechanism while still allowing the wires to connect to the barrel. And lastly, a mini USB cable has been routed through the casing to allow updating of the Arduino without removing the cover--in this case the vibration motor had already been removed to save space and make this area more accessible. Alternate component fitment This solution requires removing plastic within the wand, and printing some of the included STL mount files and stacking the PCB board then microcontroller on top of the WAV Trigger. Everything is then screwed into one of the remaining holes in the wand body.

Due to memory limitations of this device no further software updates are possible. In order to make use of this guide you will need to upgrade to either an official GPStar Neutrona Wand controller PCB or use a Mega2560 Pro Mini as linked in the DIY_BOM document. This guide begins with some explanations for common items you will encounter during the upgrade process. Note that it will be necessary to upgrade the hose and conductors between the pack and wand. This exercise is left to individual preferences on connectors and style of replacement, though you will need 4 conductors at a minimum (+5V, Ground, and TX/RX for communications). The space within the Neutrona Wand is extremely limited, though multiple components must be fit into this space. To maximize what is available, some wires from the original controller (PCB) can be directly soldered onto the microcontroller. Where resistors or inline components are required, these may be soldered between the wire and microcontroller to reduce need for an additional protoboard. If needed, a a \u00bc protoboard from Adafruit or any similar size from another manufacturer will be used.","title":"Neutrona Wand Setup"},{"location":"DIY_WAND/#special-cautions-and-warnings","text":"You will find that the wand poses some challenges due to confined spaces and fragile wires to all the stock components. The following are suggestions to help you minimize damage to existing wiring, unless you plan to remove all the stock components and connect new wires. Remove what you can of any plastic covers over the switches internally, and use a hot glue gun to carefully drip glue over the soldered ends of the toggles, rotary encoder, and any other wire connections to reinforce them as they stand. Gently separate any wires that are bonded together, allowing about 1\" of excess for stripping. Use a mechanical wire stripper to ensure you quickly strip back the sheathing for each wire. Use silicone-coated stranded wiring (22AWG down to 26AWG) to allow for maximum flexibility.

A: Sorry, no. However, premodified wands are available every so often via the GPStar web store . Q: Can I help others install kit components or add-ons? A: Yes, if you are willing to offer your skills whether free or at-cost to assist others that is acceptable. Buyers: Please be aware that anyone performing installation work on behalf of this project is doing so as a free agent and is not associated with GPStar Technologies. This project does not warranty work performed by a 3rd party, only parts produced and shipped via agents of GPStar Technologies or Frutto Technology are warrantied in the case of manufacturing defects. Q: Does this replace everything in the pack/wand? A: This solution focuses on replacement of the microcontrollers which run the pack and wand only. It is not necessary to replace all of the switches and lights unless you truly desire to do so. Although in the case of the wand the toggle switches and every other component are attached with very thin wires, so it may be worth considering temporarily removing some items to solder better (thicker) wires to avoid breakage later. Q: What are the power requirements? A: For most every component 5V is required. We DO NOT recommend voltage higher than 5V into the VIN or barrel connector jacks on the Arduino Mega or WAV Trigger devices as they can generate quite some heat with their onboard regulators for prolonged use. A pre-regulated 5V is recommended. Total draw (amperage) depends on how many optional devices you add, but 5V at 2amps is more than enough to run various pumps, lights, etc. Please view the POWER.md guide for additional info and recommendations. Q: Is a Proton Pack required? A: No, a pack is not required for a wand-only conversion. However, please note that to run a GPStar wand board off of the Hasbro battery sled, you will need to provide your own 5V DC converter to supply regulated 5VDC to the GPStar components (see above FAQ answer). By default, a GPStar Neutrona Wand board will look for a Proton Pack before activating. To bypass this and run the wand in standalone mode, insert a 2mm jumper into the PROTON PACK TX1/RX1 connector or otherwise short these pins together. For more information see the Troubleshooting Guide . Note that the GPStar II Neutrona Wand can also be toggled to use Standalone Mode via its web interface. For more information see the GPStar II Wireless Operation Guide . Q: Is a GPStar Neutrona Wand required? A: For a pack-only conversion a wand with a GPStar Neutrona Wand board is not required. However, a modified wand is required if you want full control of the pack from the wand. We now offer a \"Lite\" kit through Frutto Technologies which will allow an unmodified Hasbro wand to turn the Pack on and off and have the Pack respond to firing, similar to the original behavior of the stock Haslab equipment. Q: How many wires / pins are required for the connection between the Proton Pack and Neutrona Wand? A: 4 wires / pins are required (Positive, Negative, TX and RX). See the Hose Examples page for more information. Q: Running my vibration motors or any other DC motor is giving me noise on my sound output. A: It is recommended as per the schematics to move all your DC motors onto the right hand +/- rail on the 1/2 breadboard in the pack. You can also add 0.1uf ceramic capacitors across your DC motor terminals, however during testing this was not required as keeping the DC motors on a separate power rail away from the Arduino and WAV Trigger boards was more than enough to avoid any motor noise. More information can be found here if you want to learn more: Dealing with Motor Noise Q: Can this electronics setup run in any Proton Pack shell? A: In theory yes, with some minor modifications to the code depending on what type of LED setup you are using. This solution was designed primarily with the stock lights and switches in use by the Hasbro products. Q: Can I produce and sell kits for others for commercial purposes? A: Yes, the code is released under a GPLv3 License. Modifications or enhancements which may be useful to the community are encouraged to be contributed back to the original repository . Q: I have some cool ideas, can you add some custom bits in the code for me? A: Feel free to use the discussion section of the GitHub repository to talk about them. Anybody can contribute modifications or enhancements back to the repository (by use of a branch or fork) for review and final acceptance into the main branch. Q: Help, I fried my stock equipment or components! A: OK, not really a question but a common occurrence. Electrical mistakes can happen, and unfortunately there's no warranty or guarantee that this won't happen to you. The best advice is to start small and slow, checking your components work before you connect them to a soldered protoboard by use of a breadboard, first. If everything works or there are mistakes, you can hopefully catch those issues quickly before they become permanently installed. ALWAYS check your input voltages with a multimeter, and verify that you've connected any power sources to the correct device pins BEFORE you apply power. Reversing polarity is a common mistake, so use consistent colors for your positive and negative wires. It is also easy to over-power an LED, so check your resistors using a multimeter and if in doubt or short on parts use the next higher resistance than the recommended value--at the worst your LEDs will just be slightly dimmer but won't burn out. Much of this advice comes from hard-learned personal experiences--we've all been there, done that.","title":"General FAQ"},{"location":"FAQ/#frequently-asked-questions","text":"","title":"Frequently Asked Questions"},{"location":"FAQ/#q-can-i-send-you-my-proton-pack-and-neutrona-wand-so-you-can-modify-it-for-me","text":"A: Sorry, no.

It is not necessary to replace all of the switches and lights unless you truly desire to do so. Although in the case of the wand the toggle switches and every other component are attached with very thin wires, so it may be worth considering temporarily removing some items to solder better (thicker) wires to avoid breakage later.","title":"Q: Does this replace everything in the pack/wand?"},{"location":"FAQ/#q-what-are-the-power-requirements","text":"A: For most every component 5V is required. We DO NOT recommend voltage higher than 5V into the VIN or barrel connector jacks on the Arduino Mega or WAV Trigger devices as they can generate quite some heat with their onboard regulators for prolonged use. A pre-regulated 5V is recommended. Total draw (amperage) depends on how many optional devices you add, but 5V at 2amps is more than enough to run various pumps, lights, etc. Please view the POWER.md guide for additional info and recommendations.","title":"Q: What are the power requirements?"},{"location":"FAQ/#q-is-a-proton-pack-required","text":"A: No, a pack is not required for a wand-only conversion. However, please note that to run a GPStar wand board off of the Hasbro battery sled, you will need to provide your own 5V DC converter to supply regulated 5VDC to the GPStar components (see above FAQ answer). By default, a GPStar Neutrona Wand board will look for a Proton Pack before activating. To bypass this and run the wand in standalone mode, insert a 2mm jumper into the PROTON PACK TX1/RX1 connector or otherwise short these pins together. For more information see the Troubleshooting Guide . Note that the GPStar II Neutrona Wand can also be toggled to use Standalone Mode via its web interface. For more information see the GPStar II Wireless Operation Guide .","title":"Q: Is a Proton Pack required?"},{"location":"FAQ/#q-is-a-gpstar-neutrona-wand-required","text":"A: For a pack-only conversion a wand with a GPStar Neutrona Wand board is not required. However, a modified wand is required if you want full control of the pack from the wand. We now offer a \"Lite\" kit through Frutto Technologies which will allow an unmodified Hasbro wand to turn the Pack on and off and have the Pack respond to firing, similar to the original behavior of the stock Haslab equipment.","title":"Q: Is a GPStar Neutrona Wand required?"},{"location":"FAQ/#q-how-many-wires-pins-are-required-for-the-connection-between-the-proton-pack-and-neutrona-wand","text":"A: 4 wires / pins are required (Positive, Negative, TX and RX).

A: No, WAV Trigger is still supported. The GPStar Audio board offers advantages (smaller form factor for wand installs, smoother audio transitions, louder output, and integrated features like a 5V regulator and ground loop isolator), but existing WAV Triggers will continue to work. Q: Should I upgrade to the GPStar Amplifier II? A: The main benefit is simplified wiring: built-in 5V regulator (3A), ground loop isolator, and cleaner install. Not required, but recommended if you want easier setup. Q: How are sound effects updated \u2014 OTA or SD card? A: Audio updates still require removing the SD card. OTA updates only apply to firmware. Fortunately, audio updates are infrequent. \ud83d\udd0c Compatibility & Upgrades Q: Can I mix Gen 1 boards with Gen 2 (wand and pack)? A: Mixing is not recommended. Gen 1 uses 5V logic while Gen 2 uses 3.3V, so signals aren\u2019t directly compatible. An adapter may come later if there\u2019s enough demand. Q: What\u2019s the easiest upgrade path from Gen 1 to GPStar II? A: If you already have a GPStar/Frutto bargraph, an RGB inner cyclotron panel (or are not using LEDs in your panel), and a GPStar RGB Vent Light then you only need to swap the wand and pack boards. The old Hasbro 5-LED bargraph, non-RGB vent lights (Hasbro/Frutto) and individual cyclotron switch plate LEDs are no longer supported. Q: Will GPStar II work with smoke kits and the Wi-Fi Attenuator? A: Yes, smoke kits remain fully supported, as does the Attenuator. If you connect an Attenuator, it acts as the \u201cWi-Fi master\u201d to conserve power. Without one, the pack or wand handles Wi-Fi. \ud83c\udf92 Proton Pack & Wand Installation Q: How hard is it to install a GPStar II kit? A: Installing in the pack is straightforward (TalentCell battery, board swap, bargraph/audio board hookup). Modifying the wand is more involved, but there are excellent how-to videos available (from GPStar and NorCal Ghostbusters). Q: Should I install the Wand II board if I already have a Pack I board? A: For now, don\u2019t mix old and new boards due to voltage differences. Benefits of the new wand board include OTA updates and new sensor features (gyroscope, magnetometer, etc.). Q: Are there videos or instructions available? A: Yes, demonstration and install videos are planned, and community guides already exist. \ud83d\udc7b Ghost Trap Q: Are there upgrades for the Haslab/Frutto traps? A: Yes. Planned upgrades include: - Accurate bargraph - Screen-accurate sequence/sounds - Native smoke machine control - Louder audio - Proper \u201cno ghosts\u201d mode - Wi-Fi configuration & updates - Wireless sync with GPStar II wand Q: Where can I get trap boards? A: Trap boards are developed and sold by Frutto Technology. Pricing will be announced once firmware is ready. \ud83d\udce6 Orders & Shipping Q: I already placed an order. Can I switch to GPStar II boards? A: Yes, if your order hasn\u2019t shipped yet, it can be modified. Kits that haven\u2019t shipped will include the new boards automatically. Q: Will shipping delays affect delivery? A: Postal services are temporarily affected by new US tariff system updates, but couriers (FedEx, etc.) are not impacted. Most delays should be resolved before boards start shipping. \ud83d\udee0 Miscellaneous Q: What new features does GPStar II add? A: ESP32-S3 dual-core processor, Wi-Fi/Bluetooth, OTA firmware updates, 6-axis gyroscope, magnetometer, temperature/humidity sensors, extra ports, expansion support, and GPStar Lite integration. Q: Will there be a TVG (Video Game) kit?

Support for both lights exists as part of the Wand PCB kit. Hatlight Kit Installation Video Hatlight Kit Installation Video (YouTube) Gun Box Hat This is the easiest of the 2 modifications to make. The orange dome (fake light) can be sanded down with a dremel, then drilled out to accommodate an orange lens. This will drill through the black plastic exterior and a portion of the clear plastic which is part of the vent light and bargraph assembly. Secure the lens using any supplied washer/nut combination. An LED can be hot-glued into the lens socket and attached to the HAT2 socket (JST-PH) on the Wand PCB. Use of a red LED with 2VDC forward voltage and 20mA current is expected. Barrel Wing Hat (+Selector Button) This is the more complex assembly as it requires replacing the stock selection switch with a new momentary pushbutton type , along with drilling out a significant portion of the barrel wing. This solution is suggested to be undertaken if also considering adding the wand-tip strobe LED as the barrel must be significantly disassembled. Removal of the inner barrel with the LEDs for the wand is crucial, as well as a black plastic sleeve which protects the wiring from the button at the end. Remove the tape from the white wires inside the barrel before beginning this work as you'll need to remove that later! Preparation begins with cutting off the top of the fake pushbutton, and removing the barrel wing screws. We won't be able to completely separate it, but we can split it apart just enough to pull out the old circuit board for the selector switch. Both of these spots can be drilled out using no more than a 1/4\" (6mm) bit. Just drill through both sides, and it's expected to drill right through the old orange button. You may have to hold the button still with some pliers while you drill. Once the holes are drilled, you can widen the holes on the underside to fit the nuts for your orange lens and new momentery pushbutton. This will also allow more access to remove debris from inside the barrel and pull the thin white wires. Insert your orange lens and pushbutton from the top, and secure using their respective washer/nut combo as needed from below. It is necessary to solder on the wires for the pushbutton before installation! A drop of CA glue can help hold items in place while you add the securing nut. Once installed, it is suggested to test that you have continuity from the pushbutton wires when the button is depressed, and connect your LED and check that it both fits and illuminates from the wand PCB. Fill the orange lens with hot glue and press the LED into the socket to hold it. This will be permanent once the glue hardens, so adjustment is key! Back-fill with hot glue to keep wiring in place and secured to the back of the barrel wing. You will need to drill a small hole for the wires to enter the gun barrel just where the grip meets the wand end. To run the wires back to the gun box you can use the internal space under the existing grip, inside the barrel which will be protected by the inner sleeve. Removing the fake rubber wires will give you a location for the wires to exit the grip and re-enter the gun box. To match the original Afterlife aesthetic, wrapping in black electrical tape will complete the look and keep the wiring protected. The wiring in the gun box will need to cross from one side to the other. Making a small notch in the plastic in what would be above the barrel, the wiring can be run in that space to reach the PCB. Connect to the HAT1 and SW6 sockets using JST-PH connectors. To finish off the barrel wing look and hide the wiring, use of 1.5\" marine-grade heatshrink tubing can be used to cover the entire plastic assembly. This is similar in appearance to the Afterlife wand serving both aesthetic and functional uses.","title":"Hatlights"},{"location":"HATS/#hat-lights-optional","text":"The hat lights are a special add-on which replace the solid orange plastic dome on the top of the wand gun box and the orange selector switch at the end of the wand barrel.

As wiring is typically desired to remain internal to the hose the following approaches have been used to replace the stock 2-wire (power-only) hose with a new 4-wire solution. The existing wire loom (black hose) can be reused if desired, or replaced with a more flexible brand. DIY Hose Example #1 The following parts are utilized: 1 - CNLINKO 4-Pin Connector - Connector for the pack which uses a square connector roughly the size of the stock connection 1 - Neutrik NL4FX 4-Pole Locking speakON Cable Connector - This is the connector at the wand end of the hose 1 - Neutrik NL4MP 4-Pole speakON Panel Mount - This is the socket for the wand itself Installation For the CNLINKO, the receptacle on the pack uses soldered ports for a secure connection. To attach the panel connector to the pack you may need to start with the screws fully inserted into the socket holes along the outside and angled into the existing pack holes. Begin tightening in increments around the connector and it will be held fast to the pack. These connectors have numbered sockets which must follow a certain pattern. The exact color used here doesn't matter so much as the order on each side, and where those pins connect internally: 1 -> 5V Positive 2 -> Connects to Pack RX 3 -> Connects to Pack TX 4 -> Ground The Neutrik connectors have # markings on them and must be matched on each side. Whatever color is used for the corresponding connection to the CNLINKO should be carried forward to the speakON cable connector. +1 -> 5V Positive -1 -> Ground +2 -> Wand RX (from Pack TX) -2 -> Wand TX (from Pack RX) The socket for the wand is a panel connector which has 4 screw holes which must be sanded off. This can be done with a belt sander or hand sander. A 3D printed adapter is furnished with kits to allow the socket to be secured using the existing screw base for the original battery pack. The speakON connector uses a twist-lock mechanism for a secure fit to the panel socket and 3D printed adapter. This can be painted a color of your choice (eg. silver) prior to installation. The speakON panel connector, like the pack connection, uses a soldered connection to secure the wires. Both connections at each end of the wand will use screw terminals to attach the wiring. DIY Hose Example #2 This approach uses parts which are slightly more accurate to the movie pack, though they may be more difficult to obtain. More work is needed to convert these to HasLab use. 1 - Amphenol MS3106A14S-2P (4 pin) 1 - Amphenol MS3102A14S-2S (4 pin) 3/4 inch splitless loom (you can find this at almost any hardware store) Black electrical tape 1 - Neutrik NAC3FX-W (discontinued, see below) 1 - Neutrik NL4FC 1 - Neutrik NL4MP-ST In this example, I use 4 pin Amphenol connectors. The 4 pin version is slightly smaller than the 16s versions, however it does still work. You will need to enlarge the holes on the pack side Amphenol connector. I used the reamer on a swiss knife and slowly enlarged it until all 4 screws can bolt onto the pack. Take your time and go slow. You also need to remove some plastic in the center of the pack hole for the connector to slide on. After feeding the 4 wires running from the wand to the pack connector through both ends of the 3/4 inch splitless loom, solder the wires onto the appropriate ends on the connector. On the wand side, this uses a modified Neutrik NAC3FX-W connector. This is a 3 pin connector, but you can take it apart and use the 4 pin internals of the NL4FC which is a 4 pin connector. The NAC3FX-W is discontinued, so if you cannot find one, you can just use the NL4FC instead and not have to modify anything. I use black electrical tape to secure the 3/4 splitless wire loom to the Neutrik connector on the Neutrona Wand side and the Amphenol connector on the Proton Pack side. Provided in the wand STL folder is a printable connector which threads into the handle of the Hasbro Neutrona Wand. With this connector, you can shave down the square corners of the 4 pin Neutrik NL4MP-ST connector so it is round, and it can slide into the 3D printable connector. I then screw the 3D printable connector into the wand handle and make a mark on the bottom side of it. I remove the connector and make a hole in it. I then use a M3x5 hex socket screw (or which ever set screw you want to use) to secure the Neutrik NL4MP-ST connector into the Neutrona Wand handle. READ BELOW IF USING A MODIFIED NAC3FX-W with a NL4FC. If you are using the NAC3FX-W with the NL4FC internals, you will need to slightly modify it. In the photo below, the 3-pin NAC3FX-W internal piece is on the left. On the right is the NL4FC 4-pin internal piece that needs to be modified to work correctly inside the NAC3FX-W shell. You have to grind off some of the indicated plastic on the NL4FC internal piece on the right. Compared to the NAC3FX-W on the left, the tab sits too high, which blocks it from going all the way into the NAC3FX-W shell. A small plastic tab needs to be removed. If you are using the NL4FC shell and not the NAC3FX-W, then you can ignore this. Quick Tip For any case where the bare wires cannot be clamped down into the screw terminals tightly, it will be necessary to use Wire Ferrules on the ends of the wires to increase the surface area to clamp. Many users of the GPStar kits have reported improved success in keeping their electrical connections stable once they crimped on ferrules to their power and serial data wires. Crimping kits can be found on Amazon for $25-40, though as an alternative you can fold over the wire and apply solder to help bulk up the connection.

The existing wire loom (black hose) can be reused if desired, or replaced with a more flexible brand.","title":"Pack-Wand Hose Replacement"},{"location":"HOSE/#diy-hose-example-1","text":"The following parts are utilized: 1 - CNLINKO 4-Pin Connector - Connector for the pack which uses a square connector roughly the size of the stock connection 1 - Neutrik NL4FX 4-Pole Locking speakON Cable Connector - This is the connector at the wand end of the hose 1 - Neutrik NL4MP 4-Pole speakON Panel Mount - This is the socket for the wand itself","title":"DIY Hose Example #1"},{"location":"HOSE/#installation","text":"For the CNLINKO, the receptacle on the pack uses soldered ports for a secure connection. To attach the panel connector to the pack you may need to start with the screws fully inserted into the socket holes along the outside and angled into the existing pack holes. Begin tightening in increments around the connector and it will be held fast to the pack. These connectors have numbered sockets which must follow a certain pattern. The exact color used here doesn't matter so much as the order on each side, and where those pins connect internally: 1 -> 5V Positive 2 -> Connects to Pack RX 3 -> Connects to Pack TX 4 -> Ground The Neutrik connectors have # markings on them and must be matched on each side. Whatever color is used for the corresponding connection to the CNLINKO should be carried forward to the speakON cable connector. +1 -> 5V Positive -1 -> Ground +2 -> Wand RX (from Pack TX) -2 -> Wand TX (from Pack RX) The socket for the wand is a panel connector which has 4 screw holes which must be sanded off. This can be done with a belt sander or hand sander. A 3D printed adapter is furnished with kits to allow the socket to be secured using the existing screw base for the original battery pack. The speakON connector uses a twist-lock mechanism for a secure fit to the panel socket and 3D printed adapter. This can be painted a color of your choice (eg. silver) prior to installation. The speakON panel connector, like the pack connection, uses a soldered connection to secure the wires. Both connections at each end of the wand will use screw terminals to attach the wiring.","title":"Installation"},{"location":"HOSE/#diy-hose-example-2","text":"This approach uses parts which are slightly more accurate to the movie pack, though they may be more difficult to obtain. More work is needed to convert these to HasLab use. 1 - Amphenol MS3106A14S-2P (4 pin) 1 - Amphenol MS3102A14S-2S (4 pin) 3/4 inch splitless loom (you can find this at almost any hardware store) Black electrical tape 1 - Neutrik NAC3FX-W (discontinued, see below) 1 - Neutrik NL4FC 1 - Neutrik NL4MP-ST In this example, I use 4 pin Amphenol connectors. The 4 pin version is slightly smaller than the 16s versions, however it does still work. You will need to enlarge the holes on the pack side Amphenol connector. I used the reamer on a swiss knife and slowly enlarged it until all 4 screws can bolt onto the pack. Take your time and go slow. You also need to remove some plastic in the center of the pack hole for the connector to slide on. After feeding the 4 wires running from the wand to the pack connector through both ends of the 3/4 inch splitless loom, solder the wires onto the appropriate ends on the connector. On the wand side, this uses a modified Neutrik NAC3FX-W connector. This is a 3 pin connector, but you can take it apart and use the 4 pin internals of the NL4FC which is a 4 pin connector. The NAC3FX-W is discontinued, so if you cannot find one, you can just use the NL4FC instead and not have to modify anything. I use black electrical tape to secure the 3/4 splitless wire loom to the Neutrik connector on the Neutrona Wand side and the Amphenol connector on the Proton Pack side. Provided in the wand STL folder is a printable connector which threads into the handle of the Hasbro Neutrona Wand. With this connector, you can shave down the square corners of the 4 pin Neutrik NL4MP-ST connector so it is round, and it can slide into the 3D printable connector. I then screw the 3D printable connector into the wand handle and make a mark on the bottom side of it. I remove the connector and make a hole in it. I then use a M3x5 hex socket screw (or which ever set screw you want to use) to secure the Neutrik NL4MP-ST connector into the Neutrona Wand handle. READ BELOW IF USING A MODIFIED NAC3FX-W with a NL4FC. If you are using the NAC3FX-W with the NL4FC internals, you will need to slightly modify it. In the photo below, the 3-pin NAC3FX-W internal piece is on the left. On the right is the NL4FC 4-pin internal piece that needs to be modified to work correctly inside the NAC3FX-W shell. You have to grind off some of the indicated plastic on the NL4FC internal piece on the right. Compared to the NAC3FX-W on the left, the tab sits too high, which blocks it from going all the way into the NAC3FX-W shell. A small plastic tab needs to be removed. If you are using the NL4FC shell and not the NAC3FX-W, then you can ignore this.","title":"DIY Hose Example #2"},{"location":"HOSE/#quick-tip","text":"For any case where the bare wires cannot be clamped down into the screw terminals tightly, it will be necessary to use Wire Ferrules on the ends of the wires to increase the surface area to clamp. Many users of the GPStar kits have reported improved success in keeping their electrical connections stable once they crimped on ferrules to their power and serial data wires. Crimping kits can be found on Amazon for $25-40, though as an alternative you can fold over the wire and apply solder to help bulk up the connection. As of May 2024 all kits will come pre-crimped for the hose connections.","title":"Quick Tip"},{"location":"INSTALL_VIDEOS_JONOGUNN/","text":"GPStar Install Videos These videos have been created by community members to help you better install your equipment through visual instruction.

When the ribbon cable is disconnected it will activate the alarm mode and degrade the Cyclotron spin. The Proton Pack can run without a wand, though it can only be activated via the switch under the Ion Arm. Vibration switch in the Cyclotron switch plate enables or disables the vibration motors for both the Proton Pack and Neutrona Wand. Theme toggle in the Cyclotron switch plate changes the Proton Pack and Neutrona Wand modes between 1984, 1989, Afterlife, and Frozen Empire. The Proton Pack vibrates only while firing. This can be changed to vibrate at all times or entirely disabled. Vibration can be enabled or disabled by the vibration toggle switch in the Proton Pack. Vibration settings can be toggled via the Neutrona Wand menu system or the Neutrona Wand EEPROM Configuration Menu. The Neutrona Wand vibrates only while firing. This can be changed to vibrate at all times or entirely disabled. Vibration can enabled or disabled by the vibration toggle switch in the Proton Pack. Vibration settings can be toggled via the Neutrona Wand menu system or the Neutrona Wand EEPROM Configuration Menu. A standalone Neutrona Wand will have vibration disabled by default to save power. Vibration can be re-enabled via the Neutrona Wand EEPROM Configuration Menu. Single (centered) LED per Cyclotron lens for 1984/1989 modes by default. This can be toggled back to 3 LEDs per Cyclotron lens via the Neturona Wand menu system. The Power Cell, Cyclotron and other lighting on the Proton Pack can have the brightness independently adjusted. 1989 and Frozen Empire sound effect modes are available; they can be accessed from the Neutrona Wand menus or set with the Neutrona Wand EEPROM Configuration Menu. Super Hero and Mode Original system operation modes. Menu system with the ability to customise various settings for both your Proton Pack and Neutrona Wand. Up to 5 different power levels as indicated on the Neutrona Wand bargraph. The Neutrona Wand can be configured within the menu system to adjust the overheat settings. When not set to overheat, you can fire continuously. The Proton Pack can also be configured within the Neutrona Wand menu system to adjust the duration of smoke effects (for each power level), which smoke effects are activated (for each power level), use of overheating smoke effects (for each power level), or whether smoke is enabled or disabled entirely (for each power level). Default settings: The Neutrona Wand will fire forever on power levels level 1 through 4 and overheat on power level 5. The Proton Pack will emit smoke effects during longer firing (Default setting: enabled). This can be configured from the Neutrona Wand menu system. System Power Readiness Indicator When battery power is first applied on the Proton Pack, the lights will flicker and a sound will play to indicate that the system now has power and is ready for use. System Power Inactivity Indicator The LED at the front of the Neutrona Wand body next to the Clippard valve will start to blink after 1 minute of inactivity while the Neutrona Wand and Proton Pack are powered down to indicate the system is still receiving power from the battery. GPStar II Neutrona Wand WiFi Toggle If the Intensify switch is held down then the Barrel Wing Button is held while all other Neutrona Wand switches are off, this will toggle the Neutrona Wand's WiFi on for GPStar II boards, for example to update firmware. Optional Features Support for changing Cyclotron direction and to enable/disable smoke effects. Support for smoke effects with dedicated fans for the Booster Tube and N-Filter.

Location of optional hardware for Neutrona Wand, requires advanced modifications. Top Dial Behaviour The primary purpose of the Top Dial on the top of the gun box is to change the power level of the wand, affecting the intensity of the stream effects (indicated by increasing or decreasing the bargraph lights just as the stock wand did). Rotate clockwise to raise power, and counter-clockwise to lower power. There are 5 wand power levels in Super Hero mode and 4 in Mode Original. \u2605 New for 6.0.2+ - The default power level is now 5 (previously 1) for full power when in Super Hero Mode. This more closely matches moments from the movies such as the Sedgewick Hotel (from the 1984 film) and Afterlife (\"switch me on\") scenes. For lower power levels, the proton stream is more red. On higher power levels, the stream will appear more yellow. Note that it is the other way around for 1989 mode to be more faithful to how proton streams appeared in that film. When Video Game Mode is active and the Neutrona Wand is ON and the top toggle switch is DOWN , rotating the Top Dial will switch between weapon modes.

While the Neutrona Wand is OFF , hold the Intensify button while turning the Top Dial to quickly adjust the Neutrona Wand volume. Music While the Neutrona Wand is OFF and music is playing, turn the Top Dial to quickly adjust the music volume. Refer to the Loading The Audio Files for more information on loading additional music tracks. Toggle Operation Modes There are two modes available which replicate movie or prop-accurate behaviors of the available toggle switches. These operational modes can be altered via an EEPROM menu and will affect the startup sequence for your Proton Pack and Neutrona Wand. Super Hero Mode Operation Guide Super Hero : This is the default operation mode based primarily on how the wand appeared to work in Ghostbusters: Afterlife. Activate Toggle The Activate toggle on the gun box turns on both the Proton Pack and Neutrona Wand. The switch under the Proton Pack's Ion Arm does not need to be engaged for this to work. The green lever near the gunbox acts as a safety and must be pulled to extend the barrel before firing. This can be disabled by setting the barrel safety switch polarity to \"disabled\". While firing, the default bargraph animations slide/split the bargraph in half and scroll up and down simultaneously. Button Mash Lockout: If you press the firing button(s) too rapidly the system will malfunction and lock you out for a period of time proportional to the current power level. When in the Frozen Empire theme the pack will \"freeze over\" with an ice crackling effect, then break free to restart after a few seconds. This mimics the scene between Phoebe and Garraka when she used her modified \"Brass Pack\". Right-Hand Toggle Switch Behaviour Right-hand toggles (Bottom and Top) affect the vent light, Clippard light, and additional sound effects. The Neutrona Wand will not fire unless both of these switches are UP . Hot Shutdown : \u2605 New for 6.0.2+ - You can turn the Neutrona Wand off without turning off the Proton Pack by leaving the bottom-right switch UP when flipping the Activate switch DOWN . To shut down both the wand and pack, flip the Activate switch UP then flip the bottom toggle DOWN before flipping the Activate switch DOWN . Boot-Up Errors : If you attempt to boot up your Neutrona Wand while the top toggle switch is UP , the Neutrona Wand will boot into an error mode. Flip the top toggle switch DOWN and restart your Neutrona Wand to boot normally. This feature can be enabled or disabled in the Neutrona Wand EEPROM Configuration Menu. Quick Vent : If the Neutrona Wand is ON and the Top toggle switch is DOWN , pressing Intensify will perform a quick vent. Holding down Intensify will perform a full overheat sequence. This is the default behaviour , though this feature can be disabled in the Neutrona Wand EEPROM Configuration Menu. While in 1984 or 1989 theme mode: Bottom toggle switch turns on the vent light and plays the wand power up sound. Top toggle switch turns on the Clippard light and plays a single beep sound. While in Afterlife or Frozen Empire theme mode: Bottom toggle switch turns on the vent light and the wand plays a ramp up sound. Top toggle switch turns on the Clippard light and plays looping beeping sounds. Mode Original (Prop) Operation Guide Mode Original : This mode reflects original production documentation from 1984 on how the Proton Pack and Neutrona Wand operate together. Other variation differences are the bargraph animations, Neturona Wand sound effects and power levels. Note that the firing modes from the 2009 video game are unavailable in this mode as they are not accurate to these production notes. There are 4 power levels in Mode Original. When the Neutrona Wand is in standby mode (see toggle switch behaviours below), the bargraph settles on the first level. The switch under the Ion Arm on the Proton Pack must be switched ON . This gives power to the entire system. The slo-blo light on the Neutrona Wand will turn solid red to indicate power to the system. If you are using a standalone Neutrona Wand without a Proton Pack, double-clicking the Intensify button while the Neutrona Wand is turned off will imitate flipping the switch under the Ion Arm. While firing, the default bargraph animations slide the bargraph up and down small increments to indicate the instability and power of the proton stream. Button Mash Lockout: If you press the firing button(s) too rapidly the system will malfunction and lock you out for a period of time proportional to the current power level. Right-Hand Toggle Switch Behaviours The bottom toggle will put the Neutrona Wand into standby mode with an audible beep, and the slo-blo LED will begin to blink. If the bottom toggle is UP the top toggle turns on the bargraph, the vent light, and Clippard light and the heatup sound will play. The bargraph will ramp up and back down to the lowest level setting. Activate Toggle Activate toggle on the gun box turns on the cyclotron of the Proton Pack. To activate the cyclotron, both right hand toggle switches on the Neutrona Wand must be UP . The Cyclotron will not turn on unless both toggle switches on the Neutrona Wand are UP and the Ion Arm switch on the Pack is in the ON position. The green lever near the gunbox acts as a safety and must be pulled to extend the barrel before firing. This can be disabled by setting the barrel safety switch polarity to \"disabled\". System Modes Video Game Mode (Default) \ud83d\udcdd Super Hero mode only While the Neutrona Wand is ON and the top toggle switch is DOWN , rotating the Top Dial will select from the following weapon modes (listed in counter-clockwise order): Proton Stream (Default) Dark Matter Generator Plasm Distribution System Composite Particle System 1 Spectral (Rainbow) 2 Spectral (Holiday) 3 Spectral (Custom) 1 Spectral Mode (Rainbow) is a Proton Stream which gives a RAINBOW effect. If your Proton Pack has RGB LEDs, they will change to match. 2 Spectral (Holiday) is a Proton Stream which gives an ORANGE/PURPLE effect. You can press the Barrel Wing Button while ready to fire in this mode to switch to a RED/GREEN effect. If your Proton Pack has RGB LEDs, it will match these colours. 3 Spectral (Custom) is a Proton Stream with a user-defined colour mode. You can independently adjust the Neutrona Wand Barrel, Power Cell, Cyclotron and Inner Cyclotron colours directly from the EEPROM LED Menu system. The default colours are purple. \ud83d\udcdd Note: Spectral modes are disabled by default but can be enabled from the EEPROM Menu or flashed directly to the Neutrona Wand board. They take advantage of RGB coloured LED add-ons if installed. Proton Stream Holding down Intensify will throw your normal Proton Stream. Pressing the Barrel Wing Button while you are already throwing a Proton Stream will initiate \"Cross the Streams\". Pressing the Barrel Wing Button will fire a Boson Dart. Dark Matter Generator Pressing Intensify will fire a Shock Blast. Holding down the Barrel Wing Button will throw a Stasis Stream. Plasm Distribution System Holding down Intensify will activate the Slime Blower. Pressing the Barrel Wing Button will fire a Slime Tether. Composite Particle System Pressing Intensify will fire the Meson Collider. Pressing the Barrel Wing Button will fire an Overload Pulse. Holding down the Barrel Wing Button allows for rapid-fire. The firing rate is dependent on the Neutrona Wand's current power level. Proton Stream Effects As a nod to accuracy where possible, the proton streams are based on those observed from the movies. Most streams carry the same theme-based effects for power levels 1-4 (2-4 for Mode Original) while the maximum power setting will typically change slightly based on the final battle scenes from the respective movies. 1984 Power Level Notable Effects 1 Firing startup based on first encounter with Slimer 2 - Same - 3 - Same - 4 - Same - 5 Additional sparking sounds at \"full stream\" 1989 Power Level Notable Effects 1 Metallic \"clang\" as notable during the courtroom scene 2 - Same - 3 - Same - 4 - Same - 5 Uses the 1984 high power sound at \"full neutronas\" Afterlife Power Level Notable Effects 1 Uses the same effects as 1984 2 - Same - 3 - Same - 4 - Same - 5 New custom sounds specific for Afterlife Frozen Empire Power Level Notable Effects 1 Uses new startup sound as heard in Frozen Empire 2 - Same - 3 - Same - 4 - Same - 5 - Same - Cross The Streams (CTS) / Cross The Streams Mix (CTS Mix) The Barrel Wing Button at the end of the wand acts as a alternate firing button. When Cross The Streams is enabled, Video Game Modes are disabled and you will only have the Proton Stream on both Intensify and the Barrel Wing Button . The overheat features can only be triggered when holding the Barrel Wing Button when Cross The Streams mode is enabled. Pressing both the Intensify and Barrel Wing Button at the same time enables the \"Cross the Streams\" (CTS) audio and visual effects. Releasing either of the firing buttons will continue these effects as long as one is still held, and will end once both buttons are released. With Cross The Streams Mix, you need to hold both the Intensify and Barrel Wing Button at the same time to remain in Cross The Streams. Releasing one of the firing buttons will revert to the normal Proton Stream for that button. Cross The Streams (CTS) is the default firing mode for Mode Original. Cross The Streams (CTS) or Cross The Streams Mix (CTS Mix) modes can be selected from the Neutrona Wand Menu System.

Welcome to the second generation of GPStar Proton Pack controllers, intended for users who wish to fully replace the stock lighting of their Haslab Proton Pack or are building a DIY pack. This device improves on several core feature changes based on real-world use and customer requests. Significant Features/Changes: Processor change to ESP32-S3 SoC instead of ATMega2560, offering dual CPU cores operating at a faster clock speed. Temperature sensor for environmental responses or monitoring. Dedicated sockets for optional components and future expansion. Integrates a WiFi radio for direct web-enabled controls and firmware updates. Compatibility with an Attenuator device is still fully supported. When connected to an Attenuator which offers WiFi capability, the Proton Pack II PCB will automatically disable its internal WiFi radio to conserve power. If you set a custom WiFi password and forget it the password can be reset from the Neutrona Wand operation menu , or by removing the ribbon cable and toggling the vibration on/off switch 5 times while the Proton Pack is not running. Other Hardware Changes: Programming pins were replaced with a USB-C connector for direct connectivity to your computer for firmware updates. Integrates a power detection unit directly onboard, eliminating a separate sensor for \"GPStar Lite\" kits. The cyclotron switch panel which used individual LEDs is no longer compatible with this controller, and must be upgraded to the RGB LED panel if you wish to keep that device illuminated. The cyclotron direction switch has been removed in favor of more specialized connectors. This can be controlled via the Neutrona Wand menu or WiFi web interface. IMPORTANT: The GPStar Pack II controller is NOT backwards compatible with the original GPStar Wand controller! DO NOT attempt to mix and match wands as you can potentially damage your devices. This guide is part of the kit approach to providing a minimally-invasive upgrade to the stock HasLab controllers. For the Proton Pack all stock connections can be made using the available JST-XH connectors on all existing wiring. The diagram below details the standard HasLab connections, supporting either a \"Lite\" configuration with a stock Neutrona Wand or a fully-converted wand with GPStar Wand II controller. If using a stock Neutrona Wand you will need to use the supplied 5V output on the LITE connection. This will provide the power meter readings from user interaction. If using a GPStar modified Neutrona Wand you will need to use the labelled NEUTRONA WAND connections for serial data and power. Proton Pack - Connection Details Connections for the pack should be made according to the tables below. Ordering aligns with PCB labels or when viewed left-to-right with the connector keyhole at the bottom. Pins denoted D# correspond to the internal code and connection to the controller chip. Ground may be designated as \"GND\" or simply \"-\". Stock Connectors These are connections which should match 1:1 on the original Haslab Proton Pack if upgrading from that product. Label Pins Notes POWER 5V-IN +/- Power from GPStar amplifier or power hub. This MUST be a regulated 5V source! Volume D3/GND/D2 Rotary encoder connection for pack volume adjusted via crank generator knob. SW1 D31/GND Stock connection for main switch under the Ion Arm. SW3/SW4 GND/D27/D25/GND Stock connection for Cyclotron panel toggles: SW3 (2 pins on left side) = Year Mode Toggle. SW4 (2 pins on right side) = Vibration toggle. SW6 (ALARM) GND/D23 Stock connection for ribbon cable disconnection alarm (wire order does not matter). M1 VCC/GND Stock connection for pack vibration motor (D45) or cyclotron motor 1 . Power Cell VCC/D53/GND/PCCYC Stock connection for Power Cell LEDs (continues to Cyclotron Lid). Cyclotron D43/GND/PCCYC/VCC Stock connection Cyclotron lens LEDs (continues from Power Cell), includes lid sensor. 1 For more information on the motorised cyclotron modification see Inner Cyclotron . Special Connectors These are connections which are unique to the GPStar equipment or have a special purpose. Label Pins Notes AUDIO BOARD GND/NC/VCC/TX/RX/NC Communication and Power for the pack's GPStar Audio or WAV Trigger. Connector type: JST-PH NEUTRONA WAND 5V-OUT +/- Power to the Neutrona Wand. If using the GPStar Amplifier it is encouraged that you use one of the 5V connections on that device to directly power the Neutrona Wand instead of using this connection. Connector type: JST-XH NEUTRONA WAND (Serial) RX1/TX1 Serial communication to the Neutrona Wand. IMPORTANT: The GPStar Pack II controller is NOT backwards compatible with the original GPStar Wand controller! DO NOT attempt to mix and match wands as you can potentially damage your devices.

If looking for configuration options for the latter, please view the SMOKE guide for diagrams and references. Voltage The controller, sound boards, and all LEDs will all require 5VDC which is the standard voltage for USB devices. For this reason many simple battery packs used by the community have been using a USB to JST-XH connector for the stock HasLab equipment. For most audio amplifier choices used with the pack those devices typically require 9-12V. Meanwhile, the components required for smoke kits may use as little as 3.7V or require up to 12V. Note: You will most likely be using a rechargeable lithium-ion battery or similar to power your equipment. Unlike Alkaline batteries these do not drop in voltage as they discharge, but keep up a continuous voltage until their capacity is nearly depleted--at which time the internal circuitry will simply stop providing output. As such, reading voltage is not a reliable means of estimating battery life remaining. 2025 Update - The new GPStar Amplifier II and Power Hub II devices now allow your system to be 24V compatible. These devices can take 12V or 24V source voltage as input while still providing 5V distribution for accessories. Power Draw In addition to voltage we need to consider the amperage required for running components. You will need a power source which can deliver at least 0.6A to run the most basic kit, while additional upgrades such as the 48-LED barrel will require a minimum of 0.8A to run effectively. The 12V batteries offered by Talentcell are a popular choice as they provide up to 2A from the USB port and 3A from the 12V barrel jack. Next is the matter of how long you may wish to run your pack. For those who \"troop\" or will use their equipment for events, you need a long runtime which is a factor of the battery's Amp-Hour rating (typically stated in milli-Amp-hour or mAh). To estimate how long your battery will last you would need to know how many Amps are required to run your kit at a maximum, then divide the mAh rating by Amps. For example, a 3000mAh battery is equivalent to 3Ah, which at a constant 0.8A draw would run for approximately 3.75hrs. June 2024 Update - Since the advent of this kit several components have been added as optional equipment, and some as alternatives to original parts. When using the pack and wand controllers with GPStar Audio boards, an ESP32 and Attenuator kit, all possible wand lighting upgrades, and the GPStar Amplifier the total power draw is around 0.35A at idle and around 0.93A while firing all effects. If adding a single smoke kit for the N-Filter during overheat/venting the maximum power draw is closer to 2.92A which is approaching the maximum rating for the Talentcell batteries. Warnings \"I'm fuzzy on the whole good/bad thing. What do you mean, 'bad'?\" -Dr. Venkman For purposes of a DIY approach, in no case should you use the Arduino Mega's barrel jack to convert 12VDC into 5VDC for that board, nor use the 5V pin on the controller for running any other devices. The power converter on the microcontroller can become hot and may burn out over time, or you could easily draw more power than the Arduino can sustain, causing the need to replace the entire controller. Your best option is to utilize the 5V pin (and GND) to power any Arduino controllers which should come from a stable regulated 5V power source. The D-cell batteries supplied with the stock equipment may not be sufficient for the long runtimes expected by the solutions offered by these guides--furthermore, Alkaline batteries will exhibit a voltage drop as they drain which can fall below the minimum necessary to run the Arduino controllers. Any battery pack which uses PD (power delivery) is not recommended, nor is use of USB-C connections as these could potentially supply up to 100W of power and could destroy your equipment. Using standard USB-A connections is recommended as there are dedicated power wires which are easy to access from a modified cable and is typically limited to 2-3 Amps for output. Putting too high a load on a rechargeable battery is not good long-term for the battery or the components. The battery will be limited to a maximum output in terms of both voltage and camperage. In some cases this can present as degraded behavior for the component (eg. smoke air pumps run slower) or it could affect the controllers causing stuttering or other unexpected behavior. You are encouraged to put high-draw devices on their own separate battery or otherwise limit smoke effects to 1 device per battery if sharing with the pack/wand electronics. When using the new GPStar Amplifier in your Proton Pack, do not run more than 1 smoke device (vape coil + air pump) from any of the provided 5V JST-XH connections. The built-in voltage regulator can only provide a maximum of 3A, and when running all of the pack/wand components plus a single 5V smoke device can easily approach that maximum. Similarly, if using the GPStar Power Hub this also uses the same voltage regulator and should not be used to drive more than 2 smoke device. Options Good A standard USB battery pack with a USB-to-JST cable to deliver only the +5VDC and Ground (-) for use by all components. YMMV based on the option you choose, but it MUST support at least 2A of power for the core electronics, exclusive of any smoke effects. See the next 2 options for more recommended solutions. Better A TalentCell 1 battery pack which only offers a 12VDC output or both USB connections and 12VDC output . For models which support USB, use of a USB-to-JST cable can provide power to the core electronics while the 12VDC barrel jack will be used for the audio amplifier in the pack. Best Either of the TalentCell 1 battery packs just mentioned in conjunction with the GPStar Amplifier . The latter device connects easily using a barrel jack, such as the splitter provided with the TalentCell battery for simultaneous charging and use. The amplifier contains a built-in power regulator and multiple 5VDC JST-XH ports for connecting your GPStar Pack Controller, sending power to the Neutrona Wand, and power for the Attenuator or wireless adapter. 1 TalentCell batteries come in a variety of amp-hour ratings, though 3000mAh or 6000mAh are common capacities. Ultimate With the introduction of the GPStar Amplifier II and Power Hub II devices your Proton Pack can be adapted to run on a 24V input voltage! This will require a suitable battery such as the TalentCell 24V 82.88Wh Battery, model PB240A1 . Using Multiple Power Sources For those who wish to make use of smoke effects, the need for multiple batteries has become more apparent and recommended. Every addition and upgrade to your pack and wand comes at a cost of power, and as of 2024 the number of LEDs in use may require up to 1.2A just for the base system functionality. While most DIY and community smoke kits may require 1.5-2.5A each, which easily pushes the stated limit (3A) of a single TalentCell battery. Please follow our diagrams in the Smoke Guide for more information about how to make use of multiple batteries. With the addition of the GPStar Power Hub this is much easier as you can use a single device with a standalone battery to operate up to 2 smoke kits simultaneously. Per our recommendations, smoke kits can and should be triggered by use of a relay which also makes this scenario possible, as it provides isolation between the power source to the primary electronics from the high-draw heating elements used in most smoke kits. Charging Switch Some users have made use of what's called the \"DPDT Mod\" which uses any standard \"Dual-Pole, Dual-Throw\" toggle or switch to act as a master kill switch to the electronics, but allowing a Talentcell battery to be charged. Assuming you use both the 5V from the USB port and 12V from the barrel jack on a standard Talentcell battery (regardless of mAh capacity), the basic installation would look like this: A 5.5mm x 2.1mm (or 5521) female port is installed on the Proton Pack as a charging port All ground connections are tied together: from the USB, Barrel Jack, and Charging Port Each positive (+) connection is attached to a post on the toggle or switch as follows: The 12V+ and 5V+ to the Proton Pack are connected to the upper posts of the toggle/switch The Barrel Jack's 12V+ and USB's 5V+ are connected to the center posts of the toggle/switch ONLY the 12V+ from the charging port is connected to the end OPPOSITE the Proton Pack connections For a visual aid see the ASCII drawing below for reference. The 12V is intended to go to your audio amplifier, while the 5V goes to the Proton Pack PCB. If using the GPStar Audio Amp which can supply 5V to your pack/wand PCB's you can simply use the 12V connection only and ignore all 5V connections shown/mentioned. Note: In order to use the Talentcell or charge it, the battery itself must be in the ON position. If you wish to conserve power once charged, turn off the battery via its built-in switch if you intend to store or not use your equipment for a long period.

What do you mean, 'bad'?\" -Dr. Venkman For purposes of a DIY approach, in no case should you use the Arduino Mega's barrel jack to convert 12VDC into 5VDC for that board, nor use the 5V pin on the controller for running any other devices. The power converter on the microcontroller can become hot and may burn out over time, or you could easily draw more power than the Arduino can sustain, causing the need to replace the entire controller. Your best option is to utilize the 5V pin (and GND) to power any Arduino controllers which should come from a stable regulated 5V power source. The D-cell batteries supplied with the stock equipment may not be sufficient for the long runtimes expected by the solutions offered by these guides--furthermore, Alkaline batteries will exhibit a voltage drop as they drain which can fall below the minimum necessary to run the Arduino controllers. Any battery pack which uses PD (power delivery) is not recommended, nor is use of USB-C connections as these could potentially supply up to 100W of power and could destroy your equipment. Using standard USB-A connections is recommended as there are dedicated power wires which are easy to access from a modified cable and is typically limited to 2-3 Amps for output. Putting too high a load on a rechargeable battery is not good long-term for the battery or the components. The battery will be limited to a maximum output in terms of both voltage and camperage. In some cases this can present as degraded behavior for the component (eg. smoke air pumps run slower) or it could affect the controllers causing stuttering or other unexpected behavior. You are encouraged to put high-draw devices on their own separate battery or otherwise limit smoke effects to 1 device per battery if sharing with the pack/wand electronics. When using the new GPStar Amplifier in your Proton Pack, do not run more than 1 smoke device (vape coil + air pump) from any of the provided 5V JST-XH connections. The built-in voltage regulator can only provide a maximum of 3A, and when running all of the pack/wand components plus a single 5V smoke device can easily approach that maximum. Similarly, if using the GPStar Power Hub this also uses the same voltage regulator and should not be used to drive more than 2 smoke device.","title":"Warnings"},{"location":"POWER/#options","text":"","title":"Options"},{"location":"POWER/#good","text":"A standard USB battery pack with a USB-to-JST cable to deliver only the +5VDC and Ground (-) for use by all components.

Every addition and upgrade to your pack and wand comes at a cost of power, and as of 2024 the number of LEDs in use may require up to 1.2A just for the base system functionality. While most DIY and community smoke kits may require 1.5-2.5A each, which easily pushes the stated limit (3A) of a single TalentCell battery. Please follow our diagrams in the Smoke Guide for more information about how to make use of multiple batteries. With the addition of the GPStar Power Hub this is much easier as you can use a single device with a standalone battery to operate up to 2 smoke kits simultaneously. Per our recommendations, smoke kits can and should be triggered by use of a relay which also makes this scenario possible, as it provides isolation between the power source to the primary electronics from the high-draw heating elements used in most smoke kits.","title":"Using Multiple Power Sources"},{"location":"POWER/#charging-switch","text":"Some users have made use of what's called the \"DPDT Mod\" which uses any standard \"Dual-Pole, Dual-Throw\" toggle or switch to act as a master kill switch to the electronics, but allowing a Talentcell battery to be charged. Assuming you use both the 5V from the USB port and 12V from the barrel jack on a standard Talentcell battery (regardless of mAh capacity), the basic installation would look like this: A 5.5mm x 2.1mm (or 5521) female port is installed on the Proton Pack as a charging port All ground connections are tied together: from the USB, Barrel Jack, and Charging Port Each positive (+) connection is attached to a post on the toggle or switch as follows: The 12V+ and 5V+ to the Proton Pack are connected to the upper posts of the toggle/switch The Barrel Jack's 12V+ and USB's 5V+ are connected to the center posts of the toggle/switch ONLY the 12V+ from the charging port is connected to the end OPPOSITE the Proton Pack connections For a visual aid see the ASCII drawing below for reference. The 12V is intended to go to your audio amplifier, while the 5V goes to the Proton Pack PCB. If using the GPStar Audio Amp which can supply 5V to your pack/wand PCB's you can simply use the 12V connection only and ignore all 5V connections shown/mentioned.

This was requested if you want to instead use Smoke2 from the booster tube for another purpose. For the purpose of smoke in the booster tube, Fan2 is not required. What is a \"Smoke Kit\"? Before proceeding it should be made clear what exactly a \"smoke kit\" consists of. In simplest terms this is a combination of 4 components: a vape coil (atomizer), an air pump, a fan or blower, and a white LED. Traditionally, the vape coil will be paired directly with the air pump as it is dangerous to run a vape coil without proper airflow. The fan and LED may either be separated or combined--there are many community makers of smoke kits with various implementations where components may be bundled differently. For modders who are comfortable with building their own smoke solution we recommend viewing the DIY Smoke guide to creating your own smoke generator . For purposes of integrating and connecting a smoke solution please read the remainder of this guide. Common Materials The following may be necessary to connect your smoke generator to the Proton Pack, if not provided as part of a maker's kit. One of the following: GPStar Relay - Now shipped with most kits 5V Relay Module with Optocoupler - Must support a HIGH signal to turn the relay on! 6mm OD / 4mm ID Silicone Tubing - For routing smoke from the vape coil Disclaimers This project does not make any direct endorsements of kits available in the Ghostbusters community. As stated above most kits consist of common components which can be integrated in a few standard ways. All references to kits or makers by name is for illustrative purposes only as this team has directly confirmed operation with the kit makers. If you have a smoke kit and wish to validate integration, please reach out to the team via the GPStar Technologies Facebook group for assistance. Most smoke kits utilize a combination of vegetable glycerine (VG) and propylene glycol (PG). Please follow any kit maker's instructions for filling or replacing your smoke fluid. Some ratios work better for the type of smoke desired and may be a personal preference. The most common are either 100% VG or a 70/30 mixture, where the latter may create thicker smoke. Warnings Modification of your pack is unavoidable for proper installation as the areas where smoke must be delivered are isolated from the inside of the pack. Please proceed only if you are comfortable with irreversible modifications . One such recommended modification is the full removal of the D-Cell battery compartment which will allow access through the battery door to installed vape coils for easy refilling. Other modifications include drilling holes to fit wires and/or silicone tubing. In both the PCB and DIY approaches each of the smoke and fan pins are designed to use a transistor to run connected devices, as most devices will require more than the recommended 40mA maximum of current through the ATMega controller. Please note the following guidelines and warnings regarding safe connection of these devices: All connectors listed above provide 5V of DC power and are intended to power devices such as relays, pumps, and fans. Do not connect any device which draws more than 500mA of current to your controller. Most fans/blowers and relays can be safely attached to the Fan1 or Fan2 ports without concern as these require 500mA or less to operate. The LED-W port expects a white LED with a forward voltage of 3.0-3.2V and current draw of 20mA. The Proton Pack PCB has been tested using up to 2 Amps of current but is NOT recommended as some components may be pushed to their thermal limits and could potentially fail prematurely under extended use. Most vape coil and air pump combinations require dedicated power sources or may require a 12V power source. ALWAYS use a relay module to complete the circuit to power these types of devices! Powering a Kit Power should be provided as recommended by your kit manufacturer. Most kits run on either 5V or 12V sources so this will determine the best way to implement a power connection. Though in most cases kits operate on the principle of \"apply power, get smoke\" so the only concern is how to turn the 5V (HIGH) signal from the PCB or Arduino into something which can safely run a vape coil and air pump combination. So we have 2 steps to take: 1) how to get power for the smoke kit(s) and 2) how to switch on power safely. Now before we begin with how to power your kit, take a look at this video which shows the correlation between voltage to the vape coil and how much amperage is consumed during operation. Typically most vape coils used with many kits are 1.8ohms and like their voltage in the range of 3.3-4V, though 5V can and will work fine. Just remember that more voltage means more current, which means more strain on your battery. So if you are short on available power or have a reduced runtime you can potentially look at reducing the voltage by use of a buck converter for just the vape coil itself. Step 1: Providing Power As of mid-2024 there are now 2 standard options available for obtaining power easily from a Talentcell battery: the GPStar Amplifier and the GPStar Power Hub. Both devices accept 12VDC from the 5525 barrel jack on the common Talentcell batteries, and both use an on-board 5V regulator which is capable of delivering up to 3A of power. WARNING Do not operate more than 1 smoke kit from the amplifier. This device must consume power to run the speakers, and is also meant to provide power easily to the Proton Pack controller. This can result in pushing the voltage converter (and battery) to its stated limit and will result in poor performance from attempting to run 2 smoke kits simultaneously. The power hub device is meant to provide dedicated power to high-current devices. It has been tested by operating 2 smoke kits (5V each, at ~1.5A) simultaneously without issue. The primary and expected use-case is when used with a second Talentcell battery reserved exclusively for powering smoke effects. Some additional but optional parts which may be required for these devices: 2-Pin JST-XH Connectors w/ Wires - For connecting relay modules to the 5V ports on the amp or power hub. Male USB w/ Short Pigtail Cable - For connecting directly to the USB port of a Talentcell battery. Male 5.5mm x 2.5mm Pigtail Cable - For connecting the amp to a battery using the available terminal screws. Male-to-Male 5.5mm x 2.5mm Cable - For connecting the amp or power hub to a Talentcell battery. Step 2: Switching Power As previously noted in the warnings section, this is where a 5V Relay Module becomes necessary. For a 5V relay, this device will electrically isolate the power provided by the PCB or Arduino from the power source running the smoke generator. This is the recommended solution for safely turning on your smoke generator. Remember that most vape coils will draw 1.5 to 2 Amps so your power supply must be able to provide that safely without triggering a safety shutoff. GPStar Relay The GPStar Relay uses a standard 5V relay module but in a much easier to use package. There is a dedicated \"Proton Pack\" port which will connect to the Smoke1 or Smoke2 JST-XH connectors, a dedicated power input (expected: 3.7V-12V), and the standard connections for Normally Open (NO) and Normally Closed (NC) contacts. The center on this relay is the GROUND connection direct to the battery, making it more straightforward to connect your smoke kit. Common 5V Relay Most relays work using 3 wires: 2 for power (+/-) to the relay itself, and 1 for the signal to turn the relay on or off. One solution is to use a relay which can accept a HIGH signal to turn on and use the + connection to drive both the relay power and input signal. This arrangement typically uses less than 100mA and can safely connect to the Smoke1 or Smoke2 JST-XH connectors. Typically the vape coil and air pump will have their positive leads connected together, and the negative leads connected together. The positive from the power source will be connected to the NO (normally-open) terminal on the relay module while the combined positive leads are connected to the COM (common) terminal. The negative leads should connect directly to the power source for the smoke generator. Connection Examples For a more in-depth look at the electrical connections, the following diagrams demonstrate what is required for integrating several smoke kits available from the community. These have been either directly verified or confirmed as \"expected\" by their respective makers. Other kits or DIY solutions may be used, provided they adhere to the use of a relay for applying power directly to a vape coil device. Refer to any kit makers' instructions and recommendations for power sources and connecting cables. This solution uses a vape pen with its own built-in battery for power: The following demonstrate common kits which require 5V for operation: * The GPStar Power Hub may be used in place of the DC buck converter shown * The GPStar Power Hub may be used in place of the DC buck converter shown This device uses its own power supply for smoke, but must connect a 5V RF transmitter directly to the controller: The following demonstrates how to connect a smoke kit which requires a 12V supply: Booster Tube Installation The process involves removing the booster tube for easy access and drilling a small hole at the bottom for insertion of silicone tubing. The space below the stock D-Cell battery compartment is convenient for housing smoke generators though as noted it may be easier to access by cutting away the battery compartment itself. If using a 3rd-party motherboard, opt for the version which retains a battery door for easy access once the pack is reassembled and attached to an ALICE frame. Note: For this component a fan is not necessary as the smoke will rise through use of only the air pump device. N-Filter Installation The following 3D models are provided for those able to print components for their pack. These are designed to fit perfectly within the Hasbro equipment and provide a familiar look to the end solution for getting smoke out of your pack. N-Filter Blower Mount - Holds the 50mm blower in an upright position N-Filter Filter Cone - Replaces the stock cone and allows smoke and air to exit N-Filter Template - Used to mark where to cut into the pack for smoke tubing and blower air hole The template print will help identify the correct placement for holes which will allow the silicone tubing and LED power wires to pass through, as well as the port opening for the blower fan. Place this with the word TEMPLATE facing up for the proper orientation. Once the holes are drilled you can simply insert the blower mount into the socket from below. There will be space to access the screw which holds the cone in place, as well as routing the silicone tubing and LED power wires. The blower will be held in place by the other half of the inner cyclotron housing once reassembled--this should be done last, after the cone has been fully installed and tested. The LED and wires should be installed first, pushing the LED to the very tip of the cone. Once in place, the silicone tubing can be inserted 2-3cm (1/2\") into the same hole to keep the wires (and LED) in place. Adding some hot glue will keep these in place and prevent smoke from escaping out this hole in the cone. Once those are installed the tubing and wires can be gently pulled through the drilled hole as the cone is pushed into place and secured using the original screw. Testing Congratulations, you are now ready to test your smoke solution! While in the Video Game mode, use the Barrel Wing Button to select the Venting menu option (after all firing mode options). Put the Neutrona Wand into firing state and press the Intensify button to activate the N-Filter smoke option directly. Alternatively, regardless of mode set your wand to level 5 and throw a proton stream (or activate Cross the Streams) and wait for the smoke effects to kick in. Remember to activate all smoke options for the pack via the EEPROM menu if you previously changed these.

The following options should give you an idea of what is possible with hardware given certain space constraints. For instructions on loading audio files to a microSD card, please see the AUDIO Guide . Audio Controllers Sounds are output via one of the supported polyphonic WAV audio controllers: Robertsonics WAV Trigger or GPStar Audio. The former is a 3rd-party component originally included with all GPStar kits up until early 2024, while the latter is a fully custom solution which is part of the GPStar family of controllers for your cosplay needs.

Notably, one of the new features for the v104 is a \"WAV queueing\" or preloading of audio files for use in chained events, reducing latency for certain effects. Firmware Updates Use the FTDI to USB programming cable that came with the first generation GPStar kits or any other suitable FTDI 5V basic serial connector. The UART Pins on the PCB should align with with the standard wire order for FTDI-to-USB cables which use a single Dupont 6-pin connector. Observe these common colours and notes to ensure proper orientation: IMPORTANT: Beside the connection on the GPStar Audio board, there is a small black switch, move it to the LOAD position before connecting the cable. After flashing, please move the switch back to the BOOT position. GPStar Audio Firmware Flasher Windows (x64 only) MacOS Intel (Must enable Rosetta for Apple Silicon CPUs) Pack Audio This is where you can branch out to other options as desired and can really go all-out with your choice of audio. Neither of the GPStar Audio or WAV Trigger controllers recommended for use in the Proton Pack will use their onboard amplifier by default. In both cases the 3.5mm / \u215b\" stereo phono jack will be used. This means you can use virtually any amplifier which accepts that type of connection as an input. When you choose your amplifier, that should dictate the choice of speakers to match. Amplifiers We recommend a handful of small form-factor audio amplifiers which will provide the loudness demanded by many kit users. The following are listed in order of their peak output, but also compatibility within the GPStar ecosystem. GPStar Amplifier II - 50W @ 4\u03a9 24V Class D Stereo Amplifier This beast of an amplifier is capable of running some serious wattage through matched speakers. When provided with the recommended 24V supply voltage the output is closer to 60W @ 4\u03a9, and is therefore reserved for the most serious of users willing to install and carry a suitable battery system on their Proton Pack. It is possible to run this amplifier at 12V as well for considerable sound output at around 30W @ 4\u03a9. If using 8\u03a9 speakers, expect roughly 30W @ 24V and 15W @ 12V. GPStar Amplifier - 15W @ 8\u03a9 12V Class D Stereo Amplifier A more common class of amplifier with a 12V input. This is the same form-factor as the GPStar Amplifier II, but without the built-in heatsink. Output is identical to the Drok 15W listed next. Drok 15W Class D Stereo Amplifier While rated at 15W that is only when driven at 24V. Expect closer to 10W @ 8\u03a9 when driven with a standard 12V TalentCell battery. This is an off-the-shelf item which has been tested successfully with the full replacement kits and various speaker recommendations. In terms of capability this is identical to the GPStar Amplifier, though it has a built-in volume control if that is something you desire (otherwise the audio input will be controlled by the Proton Pack controller). It should go without saying that for any amplifier which can run on 12V, the more wattage it can output and will drain the battery faster at higher volumes. Testing of the 12V amplifiers shows a draw of 1-1.25A at full power, hence a 6000 mAh TalentCell is going to be recommended for a full day of audio playback. Speakers Speakers may be subjective to your personal tastes and budget, so kits do not ship with speakers. However, we have tested and do recommend several options which are listed below in order of quality and availability. The most important criteria is to match the speakers to the maximum output of the amplifier chosen. For instance, you would want speakers which can handle at least 60W @ 4\u03a9 for the GPStar Amplifier II. 2x LaVoce FSN030.71 3\" Neodymium Full-Range Woofer 8\u03a9 Considered by our team as the peak of performance, weight, and quality this 30W @ 8\u03a9 speaker is going to provide the lightest option with the most compatibility with all amplifiers recommended. 2x LaVoce FSF030.70 3\" Ferrite Full-Range Woofer 8\u03a9 Identical to the LaVoce FSN030.71 in specs, this is a standard magnet driver with a reduced cost per speaker. Consider this as a budget alternative. 2x 3\" Dayton Audio DMA-80 8\u03a9 Full Range Drivers These speakers are a mix of lightest weight due to their neodymium core and aluminum cone, with decent quality at 25W RMS (50W peak). Pair of 3\" Full Range Bookshelf Speaker (15W @ 8\u03a9) These are the most economical options and can be perfectly suitable with the GPStar or Drok 15W amplifiers. However, their quality is not as good as the LaVoce or Dayton Audio speakers. Accessories The following items are optional and may not even be necessary depending on the amplifier chosen. For instance, if using either of the GPStar amplifiers it is not necessary to provide a Ground Loop Isolator as this is built into those amplifiers already. 8\" Auxiliary Stereo Audio Cable w/ 90\u00b0 Jack Optional: Useful in tight locations, depending on where the amp is mounted Ground Loop Isolator - Not required for the GPStar Amplifier Recommended for 3rd-party Amps: Prevents unwanted hum and noise from the amplifier due to the LEDs 2 Input to 1 Output Passive Mixer For users who may want to mix a second source into their Proton Pack, such as an Aux-In or Bluetooth device, this is a good option to mix your GPStar Audio (or WAV Trigger) input with an external source. Note: As of mid-2024 all kits which include an amplifier will ship with the new GPStar Amplifier which is a high-powered Class D stereo amp. This device is very similar to the Drok amplifier noted, though it includes more 12V pass-through options for chaining other devices which need the full power offered by the Talentcell battery. It also includes a built-in 5V regulator which may be used for powering other kit devices via JST-XH connectors. The placement of your speakers is up to you. Though it is possible to mount a 3\" speaker in the location used for the original pack speaker, a mount should be used to help offload some of the added weight from that device. And if the stock vibration motor is not important (as the solution above will provide some physical feedback in that regard), removal of that device opens up a cavity just behind and above the cross-bar of a standard ALICE frame for another speaker. For the latter, it will be necessary to carefully drill some small holes into the motherboard of the pack for sound output. Shown below is an example of how a pair of stereo speakers may be mounted inside of the pack. The upper speaker is located where the original speaker was mounted, while the lower speaker occupies the space where the vibration motor casing was secured into the pack. Note the WAV Trigger and amplifier as shown here are mounted in the space normally occupied by the D-cell battery compartment, primarily so the volume control for the amplifier can be accessed from the service door when the pack is reassembled. That portion of the motherboard would need to be partially or fully removed if you wish to use this space as shown. Optional Part Shown: 3D Model for Pack - Upper Speaker Mount Note: Amplifier Volume Controls Most amplifier boards will contain their own dedicated volume control (potentiometer) which will adjust output from that device only. The built-in controls for the pack/wand will control the source audio (sound effects vs. music) and the overall volume output for both of the WAV Trigger boards, which will affect the input level to your choice of amplifier and in turn affect the output relative to that device. tl;dr: You should mount your amplifier in a space where you also have access to its volume control so you can adjust the pack to balance with the wand (or make it the domninant audio source) as necessary. Under normal operating conditions setting the recommended Drok 15W amplifier to 1/2 power will be sufficient and capable of outputting over 80dB from the suggested pack speakers. Higher volume may also result in faster battery drain with very little improvement in volume. The GPStar Amplifier does not contain a volume control and is preset to output at its maximum volume. To control the volume level use the available controls on the pack or wand to adjust the overall system volume. Wand Audio This is the most restrictive of spaces which means the device which provides audio must also double as an amplifier. Luckily, both options for sound can provide output directly to a speaker. While the GPStar Audio can output stereo sound to 2 speakers, there is only room for 1 speaker in the wand as mounted behind the heatsink. The stock speaker is rated at 0.25W @ 16\u03a9 and uses a cone made from plastic--essentially more of a tweeter than a full-range speaker, so it is advised that if you would like better quality sound you will need a replacement speaker. Otherwise, you can still use the original Hasbro wand speaker. Below are the listed specifications of the on-board amplifiers depending on which audio board you are using, which will affect which speaker should be purchased. GPStar Audio on-board amplifier (stereo output) Rated for 2.5W @ 4\u03a9 or 1.5W @ 8\u03a9 per channel. WAV Trigger on-board amplifier (mono output only) Rated for 2W @ 4\u03a9 or 1W @ 8\u03a9. There has been success in using this 40mm speaker rated for 3W @ 4\u03a9. While this does not fit in the standard speaker location under the heatsink (its size interferes with the retraction of the wand) it can be mounted within the base of the gun box and offers just enough sound to be heard (indoors at least) and can double as a rumble motor due to being able to reproduce the low-end sounds which the stock speaker cannot. This larger speaker can also be fitted into a optional Heatsink located in the STL folder of this repository. A potential example of how the upgraded 40mm speaker might be installed into the gun box is shown below in a DIY build. Note that in order to fit these components as shown the barrel connector for power was CAREFULLY removed (as it will not be used), and the screw posts for the wand mount were filed down to ensure they do not interfere with fitment. Other users in the community have reported satisfactory results with the Visaton speakers available through DigiKey which are both of identical specs (300 Hz to 20 kHz) and closer in size to the stock speaker. The Visaton speaker fits in the standard heatsink with little modifications or it can fit in a alternative heatsink which is provided in the STL folder of this repository: K-36-WP 8ohm K-36-MO 8ohm Optional Part Shown: 3D Model for Wand - 40mm Speaker Mount For more wand mounting solutions, refer to the DIY Wand Setup page","title":"Sound Output"},{"location":"SOUND/#sound-output-options","text":"\"Listen!

Notably, one of the new features for the v104 is a \"WAV queueing\" or preloading of audio files for use in chained events, reducing latency for certain effects. Firmware Updates Use the FTDI to USB programming cable that came with the first generation GPStar kits or any other suitable FTDI 5V basic serial connector. The UART Pins on the PCB should align with with the standard wire order for FTDI-to-USB cables which use a single Dupont 6-pin connector. Observe these common colours and notes to ensure proper orientation: IMPORTANT: Beside the connection on the GPStar Audio board, there is a small black switch, move it to the LOAD position before connecting the cable. After flashing, please move the switch back to the BOOT position.","title":"Audio Controllers"},{"location":"SOUND/#gpstar-audio-firmware-flasher","text":"Windows (x64 only) MacOS Intel (Must enable Rosetta for Apple Silicon CPUs)","title":"GPStar Audio Firmware Flasher"},{"location":"SOUND/#pack-audio","text":"This is where you can branch out to other options as desired and can really go all-out with your choice of audio.

Assembly The STL file stl/stream_effects_enclosure.stl can be used to enclose the ESP32 while leaving the USB port accessible. Firmware Flashing Option 1: Using GPStar ESP32 Firmware Uploader This uses a purpose-built flash tool just like the tools for the Proton Pack, Neutrona Wand, Single-Shot Blaster and GPStar Audio. Thanks to its ease of use, this is our recommended method for performing the first-time USB upload process. First, download either the Windows or Mac OSX flash tool from the extras folder. If you are on Linux, try Option 2 below instead. Windows: GPStar ESP32 Firmware Flasher MacOS Intel/M1: GPStar ESP32 Firmware Flasher (Mac OSX) Plug your device into a USB port on your computer. Locate the following files from the /binaries/stream directory. extras/StreamEffects-Bootloader.bin = This is the standard bootloader for the ESP32 itself. extras/StreamEffects-Partitions.bin = This specifies the partition scheme for the flash memory. extras/boot_app0.bin = This is the software for selecting the available/next OTA partition. StreamEffects.bin = This is the custom firmware for the GPStar kit. Open the GPStar ESP32 Firmware Flasher and browse to the files specified in step 2 above for each of the four requested file locations (see below screenshot). The program should automatically detect the correct COM port and baud rate (see above screenshot). If it did not, use the drop-down menus to select the correct one for your PC. Click the Upload button to flash the new firmware to your ESP32. Be patient, this process can take between 15 seconds and several minutes depending on the selected baud rate. Once the flash has completed successfully, your ESP32 should now be broadcasting a WiFi network. If the flash failed, please see Solution 2 in the \" USB Troubleshooting \" section at the bottom of this guide to manually switch the ESP32 into bootloader mode. You may also try lowering the baud rate to 115200 (if available), though note this will increase the time it takes to flash the firmware. Option 2: Via Web Uploader This uses a 3rd-party website to upload using the Web Serial protocol which is only available on the Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Opera desktop web browsers. Mobile browsers are NOT supported, and you will be prompted with a message if your web browser is not valid for use. Plug your device into a USB port on your computer and go to http://espwebtool.ghostbusters.engineering (which redirects to https://esp.huhn.me ). Locate the following files from the /binaries/stream directory. extras/StreamEffects-Bootloader.bin = This is the standard bootloader for the ESP32 itself. extras/StreamEffects-Partitions.bin = This specifies the partition scheme for the flash memory. extras/boot_app0.bin = This is the software for selecting the available/next OTA partition. StreamEffects.bin = This is the custom firmware for the GPStar kit. Click on the CONNECT button and select your USB serial device from the list of options and click on \"Connect\". Once connected, select the files (noted above) for the following address spaces: 0x1000 \u2192 StreamEffects-Bootloader.bin 0x8000 \u2192 StreamEffects-Partitions.bin 0xE000 \u2192 boot_app0.bin 0x10000 \u2192 StreamEffects.bin Click on the PROGRAM button to begin flashing. View the \"Output\" window to view progress of the flashing operation. Once the device has completely flashed (100%) unplug the USB cable and remove any remaining power source from the device. Restore power to reboot the device and confirm operation. View a quick video of what this process should look like. Your list of USB devices may differ, and it may require selecting a different device if you cannot immediately determine which connected device is your ESP32. Option 3: Via Command-Line You will need to utilize a command-line tool to upload the firmware to your device from your local computer. Note this is not recommended unless you are using a platform other than Windows or Mac OSX, such as Linux. Install the latest Python 3.x utility based on your operating system: Windows: Download the installer from Python . When installing you may be prompted to \"Add Python to PATH\", and it is recommended to accept that option. Linux: Execute sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip MacOS: Execute brew install python using Homebrew ( instructions here ) From a terminal (command line) prompt run the following which will install the pip tool along with the esptool utility: python3 -m ensurepip python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools esptool Confirm that python was installed successfully by running the commands python --version and python3 --version . Use the command that reports a 3.x version ( python or python3 ) for all following steps. We will assume python3 is available. Navigate to the binaries/stream directory within the extracted GPStar-proton-pack software release: cd <extracted_location>/binaries/stream Run the following command to flash the bootloader and firmware: python3 -m esptool --port-filter vid=0x303A --chip esp32 --baud 921600 write-flash --flash-mode dio --flash-size detect --flash-freq 40m 0x1000 extras/StreamEffects-Bootloader.bin 0x8000 extras/StreamEffects-Partitions.bin 0xe000 extras/boot_app0.bin 0x10000 StreamEffects.bin \ud83d\udcdd NOTE: If your device still cannot be found automatically you may need to view the \" USB Troubleshooting \" section at the bottom of this guide. ESP32: Standard Updates (via WiFi) This applies to all updates you will perform AFTER the first-time upload of the firmware for the device, when the private WiFi network for the Proton Pack is available via the custom firmware. Power up your Proton Pack and ESP32 device (whether standalone or as part of the Stream Effects hardware). Open the WiFi preferences on your computer/device and look for the SSID which matches \"GPStar_StreamEffects\" or begins \"ProtonPack_\" . If this is your first connection to this access point, use the default password \"555-2368\" . Navigate directly to the URL: http://192.168.1.2/update Use the \"Select File\" button and select the StreamEffects.bin file from the /binaries/stream directory. The upload will begin immediately. Once at 100% the device will reboot. Navigate to http://192.168.1.2 or http://StreamEffects_####.local to confirm that the device is able to communicate with the Proton Pack PCB. Note: If the upload fails, this is not uncommon. Simply attempt the upload again using the OTA updater. Operation Look for a WiFi network of \"StreamEffects_0000\" or similar and connect using the password 555-2368 . Open a web browser to the same name as the network name, for instance http://StreamEffects_0000.local . Security Notice This device uses a default password of 555-2368 and should be changed immediately. You also have the option of changing the SSID broadcast if desired. USB Troubleshooting Before beginning any actions when using a USB cable, be sure to use a high-quality USB cable which supports data transfer. Some cheap cables may only support charging (not data), or not fully support the power requirements of the device. Problem 1: Your ESP32 controller does not appear as a serial device in your operating system (COM# for Windows, /dev/cu.usb* for macOS/Linux). Solution 1: It is necessary to install a driver for the \"CP210x USB to UART Bridge\" onto your computer for some devices. A driver for Windows and macOS is available via Silicon Labs and has proved useful. Problem 2: The ESP32 device can be detected when using the ESPWebTool website but can't connect. Alternatively, you get a notice that the device must be reset. Solution 2: You must put the device into bootloader mode. To help with this, use the SerialTerminal website to connect to your device first: Plug ESP32 into computer Hold down BOOT button While holding BOOT, click EN once Continue holding BOOT until the firmware update tool says \"Connecting...\" then release You should see a message similar to the following which indicates the device is ready to flash: rst:0x1 (POWERON_RESET),boot:0x3 (DOWNLOAD_BOOT(UART0/UART1/SDIO_REI_REO_V2)) waiting for download Without disconnecting the device from your computer, and using the same browser tab, return to the ESPWebTool website](https://esp.huhn.me/) and complete the flashing process as described earlier in this guide as \"Option 2\".

Thanks to its ease of use, this is our recommended method for performing the first-time USB upload process. First, download either the Windows or Mac OSX flash tool from the extras folder. If you are on Linux, try Option 2 below instead. Windows: GPStar ESP32 Firmware Flasher MacOS Intel/M1: GPStar ESP32 Firmware Flasher (Mac OSX) Plug your device into a USB port on your computer. Locate the following files from the /binaries/stream directory. extras/StreamEffects-Bootloader.bin = This is the standard bootloader for the ESP32 itself. extras/StreamEffects-Partitions.bin = This specifies the partition scheme for the flash memory. extras/boot_app0.bin = This is the software for selecting the available/next OTA partition. StreamEffects.bin = This is the custom firmware for the GPStar kit. Open the GPStar ESP32 Firmware Flasher and browse to the files specified in step 2 above for each of the four requested file locations (see below screenshot). The program should automatically detect the correct COM port and baud rate (see above screenshot). If it did not, use the drop-down menus to select the correct one for your PC. Click the Upload button to flash the new firmware to your ESP32. Be patient, this process can take between 15 seconds and several minutes depending on the selected baud rate. Once the flash has completed successfully, your ESP32 should now be broadcasting a WiFi network. If the flash failed, please see Solution 2 in the \" USB Troubleshooting \" section at the bottom of this guide to manually switch the ESP32 into bootloader mode. You may also try lowering the baud rate to 115200 (if available), though note this will increase the time it takes to flash the firmware. Option 2: Via Web Uploader This uses a 3rd-party website to upload using the Web Serial protocol which is only available on the Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Opera desktop web browsers. Mobile browsers are NOT supported, and you will be prompted with a message if your web browser is not valid for use. Plug your device into a USB port on your computer and go to http://espwebtool.ghostbusters.engineering (which redirects to https://esp.huhn.me ). Locate the following files from the /binaries/stream directory. extras/StreamEffects-Bootloader.bin = This is the standard bootloader for the ESP32 itself. extras/StreamEffects-Partitions.bin = This specifies the partition scheme for the flash memory. extras/boot_app0.bin = This is the software for selecting the available/next OTA partition. StreamEffects.bin = This is the custom firmware for the GPStar kit. Click on the CONNECT button and select your USB serial device from the list of options and click on \"Connect\". Once connected, select the files (noted above) for the following address spaces: 0x1000 \u2192 StreamEffects-Bootloader.bin 0x8000 \u2192 StreamEffects-Partitions.bin 0xE000 \u2192 boot_app0.bin 0x10000 \u2192 StreamEffects.bin Click on the PROGRAM button to begin flashing. View the \"Output\" window to view progress of the flashing operation. Once the device has completely flashed (100%) unplug the USB cable and remove any remaining power source from the device. Restore power to reboot the device and confirm operation. View a quick video of what this process should look like. Your list of USB devices may differ, and it may require selecting a different device if you cannot immediately determine which connected device is your ESP32. Option 3: Via Command-Line You will need to utilize a command-line tool to upload the firmware to your device from your local computer. Note this is not recommended unless you are using a platform other than Windows or Mac OSX, such as Linux. Install the latest Python 3.x utility based on your operating system: Windows: Download the installer from Python . When installing you may be prompted to \"Add Python to PATH\", and it is recommended to accept that option. Linux: Execute sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip MacOS: Execute brew install python using Homebrew ( instructions here ) From a terminal (command line) prompt run the following which will install the pip tool along with the esptool utility: python3 -m ensurepip python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools esptool Confirm that python was installed successfully by running the commands python --version and python3 --version . Use the command that reports a 3.x version ( python or python3 ) for all following steps. We will assume python3 is available. Navigate to the binaries/stream directory within the extracted GPStar-proton-pack software release: cd <extracted_location>/binaries/stream Run the following command to flash the bootloader and firmware: python3 -m esptool --port-filter vid=0x303A --chip esp32 --baud 921600 write-flash --flash-mode dio --flash-size detect --flash-freq 40m 0x1000 extras/StreamEffects-Bootloader.bin 0x8000 extras/StreamEffects-Partitions.bin 0xe000 extras/boot_app0.bin 0x10000 StreamEffects.bin \ud83d\udcdd NOTE: If your device still cannot be found automatically you may need to view the \" USB Troubleshooting \" section at the bottom of this guide.","title":"Firmware Flashing"},{"location":"STREAM_EFFECTS/#esp32-standard-updates-via-wifi","text":"This applies to all updates you will perform AFTER the first-time upload of the firmware for the device, when the private WiFi network for the Proton Pack is available via the custom firmware.

Use the guides below to help narrow down where you are having an issue and try the suggested remedies. Should you need additional assistance, reach out to the GPStar Technologies Facebook group and either use the group search (see below) or post a question to the community. General Guidance Before continuing, be certain whether the following items have been reviewed: Check he operation switch on your audio controller: GPStar Audio should be set to BOOT. WAV Trigger should be set to RUN. Check that the microSD card is fully seated (pushed) into its socket. Check the JST connector on the PCB controller is fully seated into its socket. Verify the connections are intact and solid for GND, 5Vin, Rx, and Tx in all parts of the hose connectors. Sound files should start with a file having a prefix of 001_ and increment by 1. Music files should start with a file having a prefix of 500_ and increment by 1. Switch to SanDisk brand media as these SD cards have proven reliable in every use case. Troubleshooting: Proton Pack Since all connections to the Proton Pack utilize standard JST-XH connections to the available devices, please re-check any connections for incorrect seating and polarity before continuing. If these are in place then at a minimum you should be able to turn on the pack using the red switch under the ion arm which should cause the Power Cell lights to activate. This will be the primary means of validating that the pack controller is enabled. Pack will not power on (no lights or sounds) Confirm that the battery pack is sufficiently charged, switched to the on state, and USB-to-JST connection is in place. Pack Cyclotron (lid) will not light up Always be sure that your Power Cell device is plugged in and working, first. Both the Power Cell and Cyclotron are considered to be a single, continuious chain of LEDs and the latter will not function without the former. Note that when you first apply power to your pack you should hear and see a startup sequence which is a form of sanity check on the hardware to confirm the lights are working as expected. If using the Cyclotron Bypass (for Spirit or DIY packs) you must ensure the jumper is in place on the board to simulate the lid closure state. Removing or replacing the jumper while power is applied should result in an audio cue to indicate the bypass device is working (simulating lid removal and replacement). Pack has lights but does not play audio Re-check the 3.5mm audio cable is connected to the audio amplifier, and that the audio amplifier has power, is connected to at least 1 speaker, and volume has been turned up to at least 30%. If possible, connect the 3.5mm audio cable to a known-good audio source such as a smartphone, Alexa device, or similar to confirm that the amplifier is capable of receiving a signal. If there is still no sound from your Proton Pack, please refer to the Audio Troubleshooting section at the bottom of this page. Troubleshooting: Neutrona Wand The wand assumes successful operation of the pack, so please only proceed once that has been established. Wand will not power on (no lights or sounds) The wand is expects to communicate with the pack and will only power on when that connection is successfully established. If no lights or audio are observed when using the Activate switch, please consider the following options. Re-check the Power/GND connections in the hose to make sure they are not reversed. Also check if the ends of the wires are making contact on the Neutrik connectors when clamping down. You can tin the ends of the wires to make it a bit thicker or simply fold them over to double them up. Just make sure the Neutrik connectors are not clamping down on the rubber part of the wire. If you are using a replacement bargraph, make sure the connection cables are plugged into the proper connectors. If the power cable for the bargraph is plugged into the SCL/SDA connector on the wand board and the communication cable is plugged into the 5V power connector on the wand board, then the wand will not start up. Wand has a blinking vent light but does not start up When the wand is trying to establish communication to the GPStar Proton Pack controller, the LED beside the vent light blinks. When a successful connection is made, the light will stop blinking. Re-check the TX/RX serial connections in the hose to make sure they are not reversed. Also check if the ends of the wires are making contact on the Neutrik connectors when clamping down. You can tin the ends of the wires to make it a bit thicker or simply fold them over to double them up. Just make sure the Neutrik connectors are not clamping down on the rubber part of the wire. (Firmware 5.3.3 or later) You can test to see if your issue is related to the serial data lines for the hose connectors by shorting the wand board's pack data connector TX and RX pins. This will cause the wand to start in standalone mode and ignore the Proton Pack. Wand has no audio Re-check the connection to the speaker. Polarity should be observed for the best audio quality, though a reversed connection should still support some form of audio playback. Re-flash the latest software to both the pack and wand controllers. These devices must be in agreement for the communication layer to operate correctly. Re-check the Tx/Rx connections to the pack. If these are reversed it will prevent proper communication. Attempt to switch the wires at the pack-side connector which use screw terminals, and retry the Activate switch. Re-check the power connection to the wand. If you have a digital multimeter available, set the device to the DC power measurement and check that the 5V-OUT connection is supplying the expected voltage. Be careful to not short out the pins and mind the polarity. Wand has audio briefly before it cuts out Re-check the connection to the speaker terminal blocks on the Audio board. Make sure the wires seat well, if needed, add a dab of solder onto the ends. If there is still no sound from your Neutrona Wand, please refer to the Audio Troubleshooting section at the bottom of this page. The music I added is not playing back Make sure to following the naming conventions that are indicated in the Loading The Audio Files guide. Remove any metadata that may be embedded in your wav files. This can cause problems with loading the music. Music files need only be copied to the Proton Pack microSD card, but it is recommended to copy them to the Neutrona Wand as well for ease of use and the ability to swap cards if necessary. The Neutrona Wand will only play music through its speaker when running in Standalone mode. I'm firing but no overheating is happening! If your pack and wand are on default settings (you may test this by entering the EEPROM Configuration Menu then pressing Intensify to clear all settings, then turn off the Talentcell battery so the changes take effect), only Power Level 5 will overheat, and will do so after 30 seconds. If you have made changes to EEPROM settings, here are common reasons why overheating may not occur as expected. If you are in Cross The Streams or Cross The Streams Mix instead of Video Game Modes, overheating will only occur when using the alternate fire button (Barrel Wing Button). No overheating will occur if you hold Intensify by itself. Check to make sure you have the global Overheating setting enabled. If this is disabled, no overheating will ever occur. Check to make sure that the overheating toggle for the specific power level you are in is also enabled (enabling overheating generally will not automatically enable it for all power levels). Check to see what you have the Overheat Start Delay for the specific power level you are in set to. For example, merely enabling overheating for Power Level 1 will mean it will take 60 full seconds before overheating triggers by default. Neutrona Wand Standalone Mode If you wish to use the Neutrona Wand without a Proton Pack you can install a 2.0mm jumper into the PROTON PACK TX1/RX1 pins on the Neutrona Wand circuit board to enable standalone mode (see below image). This is useful for debugging whether an issue with your Proton Pack serial connection is the cause of your wand issues, or you simply want to play with the wand without a GPStar Proton Pack. The GPStar II Neutrona Wand board can also be toggled to use Standalone Mode directly from the Special Device Settings page in the web UI. For more information see the GPStar II Wireless Operation Guide . Troubleshooting: Audio IMPORTANT: Metadata Problems When adding extra music to your system, many audio software tend to add metadata information into the file. This will prevent the file from playing. As simple as importing the file into Audacity and re-exporting will solve the issue, or you can use any other software to remove the Meta Data information. Depending on which audio board or amplifier you are using in your system, following the troubleshooting guides below. GPStar Amplifier Troubleshooting When using the GPStar Amplifier I V1.0, if no audio is heard but the green LED is lit, make sure that 2 jumpers are attached on the 6 pin JST connector near the center of the board. This connector is reserved for use with a 250k stereo potentiometer but must be configured to allow audio to pass when one is not in use. The following table shows the 2 pairs of pins which must be jumpered for operation. R-I R-O GND L-I L-O GND X X X X Remember that a ground loop isolator is not required for this device as this is built into the hardware. Use of an additional isolator may negatively impact the audio quality. GPStar Audio Troubleshooting Make sure your WAV files are named properly and are located in the root directory of the microSD card. When you first power on GPStar Audio, it will locate and index the files and then the green LED will blink at half second intervals. NOTE: As of firmware 5.4.4, once the GPStar Audio successfully connects to one of the device boards the green LED will turn off to prevent light bleed. If there\u2019s no activity on the green status LED whatsoever when you first power up the GPStar Audio, check the \u201cBOOT/LOAD\u201d switch next to the 6 pin JST-XH connector is in the \u201cBOOT\u201d position. Once you see the green status LED blinking slowly, pressing the on-board \"Test\" button will play the lowest numbered track on the microSD card. Confirm this by observing the green status LED turning blinking very rapidly to indicate a track is playing. You should hear the track through the stereo jack or any speaker connected to the board. NOTE: As of firmware 5.4.4, this LED will not blink if the GPStar Audio has successfully connected to GPStar equipment. The GPStar Audio can be tested outside of equipment by plugging your GPStar Programming Cable into the white device connector and connecting the USB cable to your computer. Low quality SD Cards sometimes provide issues such as sounds not playing. Please consider using high quality SD Cards. We recommend the Sandisk Extreme A1/A2 U3 V30 32GB Micro SD Cards. If you\u2019ve gotten this far and tracks won\u2019t play, then it\u2019s most likely that your WAV files are not the correct format. GPStar Audio will only play uncompressed WAV files formatted as 16-bit, stereo, 44.1kHz, and there can be no meta-data (non-audio data) in the file before the audio data. It seems that many Mac audio applications insert a meta-data chunk prior to the audio, and this will prevent the track from playing. In such cases, simply importing the file and re-exporting with Audacity will likely fix the problem. Please remove any metadata contained in the music wav files you add, as it can cause issues loading the file for playback. WAV Trigger Troubleshooting Startup Blinking Patterns: 1x (long) - 1 long blink upon startup indicates that the SD card is no good or the formatting was bad. Re-format fully using your OS or the provided guiformat.exe utility in extras (for Windows only). Name brand microSD cards are highly recommended, with SanDisk having been proven the most reliable so far. 3x (quick) - 3 quick blinks in succession is the normal pattern at initial power-up to indicate the device has initialized without issues. Post Startup Blinking Patterns 1x - The WAV Trigger will blink once every ~4 seconds when the PCB and device are powered on. This indicates a regular serial connection checking the status of the WAV Trigger and is to be expected. WAV Trigger Troubleshooting Make sure your WAV files are named properly and are located in the root directory of the microSD card. When you first power on the WAV Trigger, it will locate and index the files and then blink 3 times to indicate that it found at least one WAV file. One long blink means that it either couldn\u2019t read the card or it didn\u2019t find any WAV files. If there\u2019s no activity on the \"Red\" status LED whatsoever when you power up the WAV Trigger, check the \u201cLoad/Run\u201d switch next to the power connector and make sure it\u2019s in the \u201cRun\u201d position. Once you get the 3 blinks, pressing the on-board button will play the lowest numbered track on the microSD card. Confirm this by observing the status LED turning on to indicate a track is playing. You should hear the track through the stereo jack. If the audio is not working, try plugging in a set of headphones into the 3.5mm audio port and test again. If you\u2019re using the on-board audio amp and speaker connection, you won\u2019t hear anything unless the onboard amp is enabled using the init file or via software. Low quality SD Cards sometimes provide issues such as sounds not playing. Please consider using high quality SD Cards. We recommend the Sandisk Extreme A1/A2 U3 V30 32GB Micro SD Cards. If you\u2019ve gotten this far and tracks won\u2019t play, then it\u2019s most likely that your WAV files are not the correct format.

Welcome to the second generation of GPStar Proton Wand controllers, intended for users who wish to fully replace the stock lighting of their Haslab Neutrona Wand or are building a DIY wand. This device improves on several core feature changes based on real-world use and customer requests. Significant Features/Changes: Processor change to ESP32-S3 SoC instead of ATMega2560, offering dual CPU cores operating at a faster clock speed. Integrates a WiFi radio for direct web-enabled controls and firmware updates. Features a 6-axis gyroscope and acceleration sensor for motion response. Dedicated sockets for optional components and future expansion. An infrared LED add-on will be coming in the future to support integration with the Ghost Trap. Other Hardware Changes: Programming pins were replaced with a USB-C connector for direct connectivity to your computer for firmware updates. Support for the stock Vent/Top lights has been deprecated for the addressable GPStar RGB LED vent light device instead. Support for the stock 5-LED bargraph has been deprecated in favor of a true multi-segment bargraph. Only i2c bus modules are supported (either Frutto Technology or GPStar bargraph devices). Older \"2.0\" Frutto bargraph units are NOT COMPATIBLE and must be upgraded to 3.0 or higher. GPStar bargraph units are already fully compatible. IMPORTANT: The GPStar Wand II controller is NOT backwards compatible with the original GPStar Pack controller! DO NOT attempt to mix and match wands as you can potentially damage your devices. This guide is part of the kit approach to providing a minimally-invasive upgrade to the stock HasLab controllers. For the Neutrona Wand all available connections for JST-PH wiring is present, though a significant amount of wire-cutting will be required to separate the stock controller and re-attach using terminal blocks on the new PCB. This device drops support for the 5-LED bargraph offered as part of the stock wand configuration and instead requires the use of a 28-segment or 30-segment bargraph. Additionally, support for the stock 2-LED top/vent light assembly is replaced by a single wire for the RGB LED vent light.

These sensors can be finely calibrated to provide more accurate data after it is fully installed into your GPStar Neutrona Wand II (or GPStar Single Shot Blaster II), taking into account nearby magnetic sources such as a speaker. To begin, connect to the WiFi on the GPStar Neutrona Wand II, enabling first via the Operational Menu Level 3 -> Option 5 -> Intensify . Calibration Options Once connected to the Neutrona Wand via WiFi and accessing the web UI, click on the Calibration Menu icon at the top (a circle with a center dot). You will have a choice of calibrating either the gyroscope or magnetometer. Full instructions can be seen by clicking/touching the collapsed header which will expand a larger section of text explaining the process. Before You Begin Click on the Settings tab at the top of the UI and go to the \"Special Device Settings\" page. Available in this section is the Controller Installation Orientation selection. This sets the intended installation of the sensors which is crucial for identifying the X, Y, and Z axes for spatial orientation. For example, on Hasbro Neutrona Wands, it will be \"Components Down, USB Front\". For a Mack's Factory Neutrona Wand, it will be in a different orientation such as \"Components Left, USB Front\". Please note that changing the orientation will reset the magnetic offset values and re-calibration will be required. This option MUST be correctly selected and saved BEFORE starting any calibration processes! Gyroscope Calibration Calibration of the gyroscope is very much a hands-off approach and quite simple. The device should be laid flat on a solid surface, rightside-up, and as level as possible. Press the Gyro Calibration button to begin the process which will run for 30 seconds. A countdown timer will report the time remaining and an audible beep will be heard from the device each second as it counts down. Once completed, all data will be automatically stored into the device's memory for immediate use when you pick it up. Magnetic Calibration Calibration of the magnetometer is much more hands-on as it requires you to move the device in the air in multiple directions to fully capture magnetic readings for the X, Y, and Z axes. Starting Magnetic Calibration Press the Start Calibration button. The system will now will ask you to rotate your Neutrona Wand relatively slowly in all directions. A visual calibration monitor will appear on screen to show your progress. Rotate your Neutrona Wand slowly to fill it with dots until the Coverage Density is as close as possible to 100%, though anything over 60% will give sufficient results and will be the threshold used when confirming the end of calibration. TIP: Point the Neutrona Wand down, and slowly raise it up in an arc. Turn slightly and then arc back to full down. Repeat this process until you have done a 360. If possible, twist your arm while holding the device or trace figure-eights in the air as you move to more quickly increase the coverage density. Stopping Magnetic Calibration When you are satisfied with the results or the coverage value no longer changes, click on the Stop Calibration button. You will be prompted to confirm that you wish to end collection of data and save the newly calibrated settings into the system memory. Note: You must have at least 60% coverage in order for the calibration data to be effective! If you exit the calibration process before reaching 60% you will be given a confirmation to either continue collecting data or stop the process. If below the threshold of 60% no calibration values will be calculated or stored and the system will revert to default values. Verifying Magnetic Calibration On the \"Special Device Settings\" page as shown at the top of this page, you should see magnetic offset information which displays \"Hard Iron\" (geo-magnetic corrections) and \"Soft Iron\" (nearby magnetic interference). These values will reflect the customised magnetic profile explicitly for your Neutrona Wand. It is not advised to modify these values by hand, though they remain available for special debugging purposes only.","title":"Sensor Calibration"},{"location":"WAND_CALIBRATION/#calibration-options","text":"Once connected to the Neutrona Wand via WiFi and accessing the web UI, click on the Calibration Menu icon at the top (a circle with a center dot).

The WAV Trigger software updater and instructions can be found on the Robertsonics website . To update the firmware, an FTDI Basic (5V version) from Sparkfun should be used to interface with the WAV Trigger. You may also use any USB-to-serial adapter, so long as it is a TTL-level device, not RS- 232. Plugging RS-232 level signals into the WAV Trigger serial interface will damage the WAV Trigger!

WAV Trigger Flasher Utility v2.00 Windows Executable (zip) WAV Trigger Flasher Utility v2.00 OS X (10.11 and above) (dmg) Only 4 connections between the boards will be required: TX/RX and 5V/Ground. Firmware Summary Steps Solder wires directly or use a row of pin headers to the holes along the bottom right edge of the WAV Trigger (as viewed with the barrel connector oriented at the top left). Solder the small pad marked \"5V\" just below the sockets for SPKR +/-. This will allow the WAV Trigger to operate from the 5V supplied by USB and later the battery for your Proton Pack. There is a small switch near the power connect (barrel) to on the WAV Trigger, set it to the \u201cload\u201d position. Connect the following wires from the FTDI to WAV Trigger: RX on the FTDI to the TX of the WAV Trigger. TX from the FTDI to the RX of the WAV Trigger. 5V from the FTDI to 5Vin. GND from one side to the other. Plug in the USB cable from your computer to the FTDI board. Run the WT-Flasher app on your computer, then click on BROWSE and navigate to and select the 1.40 firmware hex file WAVTrig_20231001_v140.hex that you downloaded from the extras folder in this repository. Once connected to your computer, click the RESCAN button and select the device from the drop down USB Serial Port menu. Then click the PROGRAM button. The app should establish communication and begin flashing the new firmware. After it has finished updating the firmware, disconnect everything and set the black switch back from LOAD to RUN . While flashing, you will see a number % progress indicator at the bottom of the Flasher software window indicating the status of the flashing progress. IMPORTANT: Make sure after flashing the firmware to set the small switch on the WAV Trigger back to the RUN position. Note the \"5V\" pad just below the SPKR connection holes. Connections Once the firmware is updated to 1.40 and you have confirmed this using the WAV Trigger setup utility, there will be connections made to the respective microcontroller boards. Similar to the previous step the RX and TX will go to the respective TX and RX ports on the microcontroller boards. See the setup instructions for the Pack and Wand as necessary. The 5Vin and GND will be connected to the power to each of the pack and wand, respectively. DO NOT use the 5V port on either Mega or Nano to drive this device--you will need to split your power connection to each device to provide sufficient current. NOTE: See below for more information. I used standard breadboard friendly header jumper cables to make the connections from the FTDI basic to the connectors I added to the WAV Trigger. Also note that the WAV Triggers have both a AUX output and/or 2 pins for audio output. You can use either or to connect to your speakers or amps. IMPORTANT: You will need to solder the 5V pad on the WAV Trigger to enable 5V power from the device. After you do this, NEVER USE the BARREL CONNECTOR for power.

This means that in order to get information from endpoints such as /status you would need to constantly make a request at regular intervals to obtain data. This is inefficient and can put unnecessary load on the device when no interactions have occurred. Instead, when real-time updates are required we can instead have the devices \"push\" information as it happens directly from user input or other events. The built-in web server offers a special URI endpoint /ws to support WebSockets . This is much more efficient as it 1) only sends data as the system changes states, and 2) is meant to report only the information necessary for interactions. All devices support the WebSocket output, which primarily reports the current device status and is updated after specific system actions occur. Note that while this data will always be in the form of a JSON object, some events may send a plain string, so always check the contents of the text data carefully before usage to ensure you are working with the expected data format.","title":"Web API Reference"},{"location":"WEB_API_REFERENCE/#web-based-api-reference","text":"This guide will cover the web interface available via an Attenuator or standalone WiFi add-on which offers a visual, web-based UI capable of controlling operations of your Proton Pack and Neutrona Wand.

This means that in order to get information from endpoints such as /status you would need to constantly make a request at regular intervals to obtain data. This is inefficient and can put unnecessary load on the device when no interactions have occurred. Instead, when real-time updates are required we can instead have the devices \"push\" information as it happens directly from user input or other events. The built-in web server offers a special URI endpoint /ws to support WebSockets . This is much more efficient as it 1) only sends data as the system changes states, and 2) is meant to report only the information necessary for interactions. All devices support the WebSocket output, which primarily reports the current device status and is updated after specific system actions occur.

Proton Pack If you have a Attenuator connected, the GPStar Proton Pack II will turn off its WiFi for power saving. You can manually turn on or turn off the WiFi for it from the OPERATION_MENUS To connect to the GPStar Proton Pack II over WiFi, a private WiFi network (access point) which will appear as \"GPStar_Pack2\" , and this will be secured with a default password of 555-2368 . Once connected, your computer/phone/tablet should be assigned an IP address starting from \"192.168.1.100\" with a subnet of \"255.255.255.0\" . Please remember that if you intend to have multiple devices connect via this private WiFi network you will be assigned a unique IP address for each client device (eg. phone, tablet, or computer). A web-based user interface is available at http://gpstar_pack2.local or http://192.168.1.4 to view the state of your Proton Pack and Neutrona Wand, and to manage specific actions. The available sections are described below. Tab 1: Equipment Status The equipment status will reflect the current state of your Proton Pack and Neutrona Wand and will update in real-time as you interact with those devices. This information is available as either a text-based or graphical display, or both if you prefer (set via Preferences). When using the graphical display, most components of the Proton pack and Neutrona Wand are represented by colour-coded overlays on the component will may be affected by runtime actions: The top of the display will indicate the mode (Standard = Mode Original, Upgraded = Super Hero) along with the year theme (V1.9.8x or V2.0.2x). When the Ion Arm switch is engaged for Mode Original, the overlay for the Ion Arm will be green to indicate a ready state. When in Super Hero mode this overlay will be green when the Proton Pack is powered on. When the Proton Pack is powered on: The Power Cell, Booster Tube, and Cyclotron overlays will be green as their default state. When the Cyclotron is in a normal state the overlay will be green. It will change to yellow then red as it goes through the pre-warning and overheat states. During venting the overlay will be blue to indicate the recovery period. The color state of the Booster Tube is linked to the \"Output\" text value which is the voltage measured at the Proton Pack PCB (in volts, but displayed as Gev). During high power draw events such as smoke generation the voltage can drop briefly, and will be reflected as a red overlay when that value is below 4.2V When the Neutrona Wand is powered on, the overlay above the Activate/Intensify portion of the gun box will indicate if the barrel is retracted (red) or extended (green). The current power level for the Neutrona Wand will be indicated by the \"L-#\" beside the barrel. The type of firing mode will be displayed below the Neutrona Wand and will be color coded via the barrel. Color intensity increases with the power level. Proton Stream: Red (includes Spectral modes) Plasm System: Green (incl. for 1989 theme) Dark Matter Gen.: Blue Particle System: Orange Settings: Gray When using the power-detection feature with a stock Haslab Neutrona Wand the default stream will be Proton with a power level of 5. Instead of the stream type being displayed, there will be a wattage value displayed as Gigawatts (GW). If the Ribbon Cable is removed, a warning icon will appear over that component to indicate an alarm state. When the Cyclotron lid is removed a radiation exposure warning will be displayed at the bottom of the CRT display. Note: When using the text-based display, if you see a \"\u2014\" (dash) beside the labels it can indicate a potential communication issue. Simply refresh the page and/or check your WiFi connection to the device. Special thanks and credit to fellow cosplayer Alexander Hibbs (@BeaulieuDesigns87) from the South Carolina Ghostbusters , who created the amazingly detailed Proton Pack and Neutrona Wand technical illustration, available as a printed poster or digital image . He has graciously provided a version of his design to make the new graphical interface. Tab 2: Audio Controls This section allows full control of the system (overall) volume, effects volume, and music volume along with the ability to mute/unmute all devices. The current volume levels will be shown and updated in real-time whether adjusted via the web UI, the pack, or the wand. For playback of music you can use the improved navigation controls: Indicator Track Action \u25c0\u25c0 Previous \u25a2 \u25b6 Start/Stop \u25ae\u25ae \u25b6 Pause/Resume \u25b6\u25b6 Next/Skip You may also jump directly to a specific track for playback via the selection field (switching immediately if already playing, otherwise that track will be started via the Start/Stop button). By default, only the track numbers are known to the audio device as all music tracks must begin at value \"500\" per the naming convention used by the GPStar controller software. However it is possible to add a track listing to the device's memory so that user-friendly song names can be displayed. See the Special Device Settings Section described below for more information. Tab 3: Pack Controls Controls will be made available on a per-action or per-state basis. Shown here, the pack and wand are both in an Idle state while in the \"Super Hero\" operation mode which allows the pack to be turned on/off remotely. The options to remotely vent or to \"Attenuate\" are only enabled when the devices are in a specific state. Vent: This can only be triggered remotely when in the \"Super Hero\" mode and while the Pack State is \"Powered\". Attenuate: When firing, the Cyclotron State must be either \"Warning\" or \"Critical\" to enable this button. Smoke: Enable or disable smoke effects. Vibration: Enable or disable Proton Pack vibration. Cyclotron Rotation Direction: Set your cyclotron rotation from clockwise or counter clockwise. Theme: Set the theme mode of your Proton Pack between: 1984, 1989, Afterlife or Frozen Empire. Stream: Change the stream type as you would using the top-dial directly on the Neutrona Wand. Tab 4: Preferences / Administration These provide a web interface for managing options which are accessed via the LED or Config EEPROM menus. The settings are divided into 4 sections: Special Device Settings, Proton Pack, Neutrona Wand, and Overheat/Smoke. The features available via these sections will be covered in-depth later in this document. These links allow you to change or control aspects of the available devices in lieu of the EEPROM menu. Update Firmware - Allows you to update the firmware using Over-the-Air updates. See the FLASHING guide for details Secure Device WiFi - Allows changing of the default password for the private WiFi network Change WiFi Settings - Provides an optional means of joining an existing, external WiFi network for access of your device Restart/Resync - Allows a remote restart of the software by performing a reboot ONLY of the device At the bottom of the screen is a timestamp representing the date of the software build for the firmware, the current GPStar Audio Firmware version, along with the name of the private WiFi network offered by the current device. If connected to an external WiFi network the current IP address and subnet mask will be displayed. Special Proton Pack Device Settings The special device settings allows you to change the graphical user interface, change the private network name and adding track names to music. Proton Pack Settings Set options related specifically to the Proton Pack. Options such as the color/saturation sliders will only take effect if you have installed upgrades to the RGB Power Cell and Cyclotron lid light kits. Similarly, the Video Game mode option will have no effect on the stock Haslab LEDs. Reminder: The ability to update settings or save to EEPROM will be disabled so long as the pack and wand are running. Turn off all physical toggles to set these devices to an idle state before adjusting settings. Refresh the page to get the latest values for preferences. \ud83d\udcdd Note: When changing options such as the count of LEDs in use for a device, or some options such as the Operation Mode, a full power-cycle of the equipment is required after saving to EEPROM. Neutrona Wand Settings Set options related specifically to the Neutrona Wand. These can be accessed from the GPStar Proton Pack II, or by connecting to the GPStar Neutrona Wand II directly over WiFi. Reminder: The ability to update settings or save to EEPROM will be disabled so long as the pack and wand are running. Turn off all physical toggles to set these devices to an idle state before adjusting settings. Refresh the page to get the latest values for preferences. \ud83d\udcdd Note: When changing options such as the count of LEDs in use for a device, a full power-cycle of the equipment is required after saving to EEPROM. Overheat/Smoke Settings Adjust overall smoke effects (toggle on/off) and adjust per-level effects. Naturally, these options will have no effect on operation without a smoke kit installed. Reminder: The ability to update settings or save to EEPROM will be disabled so long as the pack and wand are running. Turn off all physical toggles to set these devices to an idle state before adjusting settings. Refresh the page to get the latest values for preferences. External WiFi Settings It is possible to have your device join an existing WiFi network which may provide a more stable network connection. Access the \"Change WiFi Settings\" page to make the necessary device modifications. Enable the external WiFi options and supply the preferred WiFi network name (SSID) and WPA2 password for access. Optionally, you may specify an IP address, subnet mask, and gateway IP if you wish to use static values. Otherwise, the device will obtain these values automatically from your chosen network via DHCP. Save the changes, which will cause the device to reboot and attempt to connect to the network (up to 3 tries). Return to the \"Change WiFi Settings\" section to observe the IP address information. If the connection was successful, an IP address, subnet mask, and gateway IP will be shown. While connected to the same WiFi network on your computer/phone/tablet, use the IP address shown to connect to your device's web interface. Use of an unsecured WiFi network is not supported and not recommended. Neutrona Wand The WiFi on the GPStar Neutrona Wand II is disabled for power saving measures when it is connected to a GPStar Proton Pack II. You can manually turn on or turn off the WiFi for the GPStar Neutrona Wand II from the OPERATION_MENUS When a GPStar Neutrona II is connected to a GPStar Proton Pack II, all the Neutrona Wand settings can be accessed from the GPStar Proton Pack II. To connect to the GPStar Neutrona Wand II over WiFi, a private WiFi network (access point) which will appear as \"GPStar_Wand2\" , and this will be secured with a default password of \"555-2368\" . Once connected, your computer/phone/tablet should be assigned an IP address starting from \"192.168.1.100\" with a subnet of \"255.255.255.0\" . Please remember that if you intend to have multiple devices connect via this private WiFi network you will be assigned a unique IP address for each client device (eg. phone, tablet, or computer). A web-based user interface is available at http://gpstar_wand2.local or http://192.168.1.6 to view the state of your Neutrona Wand, and to manage specific actions. The available sections are described below. Tab 1: Neutrona Wand Status The Neutrona Wand status screen will display the real time rotational coordinates and other sensor data in real time. Moving your Neutrona Wand up, down, and or rotating will automatically update visually on screen. Two buttons at the bottom of the screen allow you to re-centre the 3D representation of your Neutrona Wand and also to trigger a Infrared Signal if you have a GPStar Infrared sensor attached to your Neutrona Wand. Tab 2: Audio Controls The same as seen in the Audio Controls in the Proton Pack settings above. Tab 3: Sensor Calibration The GPStar Neturona Wand II is equipped with a gyroscope and magnetometer. The sensors can be even more finely calibrated to provide more accurate data after it is fully installed into your Neutrona Wand, taking into account nearby magnetic sources such as a speaker. You can begin a sensor calibration by pressing the Enable Calibration button. You will then start relatively slowly rotating your Neutrona Wand in all directions. A visual calibration monitor will appear on screen to show your progress. Rotate the Neutrona Wand to fill in the dots until the coverage is as close as possible to 100%. TIP: Point the Neutrona Wand down, and slowly raise it up in an arc. Turn slightly and then arc back to full down. Repeat this process until you have done a 360. Press the Disable Calibration button when you are finished to save the newly calibrated settings into the system memory. Note: You must have at least 60% coverage in order for the calibration data to be effective! If you exit the calibration process before reaching 60% you will be given a confirmation to either continue collecting data or stop the process and no calibration values will be calculated. See the WAND_CALIBRATION for more details. Tab 4: Preferences / Administration These provide a web interface for managing options which are accessed via the LED or Config EEPROM menus. The settings are divided into 4 sections: Special Device Settings, Neutrona Wand Settings. These links allow you to change or control aspects of the available devices in lieu of the EEPROM menu. Update Firmware - Allows you to update the firmware using Over-the-Air updates. See the FLASHING guide for details Secure Device WiFi - Allows changing of the default password for the private WiFi network Change WiFi Settings - Provides an optional means of joining an existing, external WiFi network for access of your device Restart/Resync - Allows a remote restart of the software by performing a reboot ONLY of the device At the bottom of the screen is a timestamp representing the date of the software build for the firmware, the current GPStar Audio Firmware version, along with the name of the private WiFi network offered by the current device. If connected to an external WiFi network the current IP address and subnet mask will be displayed. Special Neutrona Wand Device Settings In the Special Device Settings for the Neutrona Wand, you can customize the name of the private wireless network when WiFi is enabled for the device. The purpose of the Controller Installation Orientation Menu option is to establish the correct X, Y, and Z directions for the sensors relative to how the GPStar Neutrona Wand II board is installed inside your Neutrona Wand body. For example, on Hasbro Neutrona Wands it will be \"Components Down, USB Front\"; for a Mack's Factory Neutrona Wand, it will be in a different orientation such as the \"Components Right, USB front\". The magnetic offset information it editable but not recommended to do so unless you understand the purpose. The display of \"Hard Iron\" (magnetic corrections) and \"Soft Iron\" (nearby metallic interference) can be used to verify that calibration of the device produced unique values to your Neutrona Wand device. These will be applied automatically to sensor readings to ensure consistent and stable behavior. A toggle to enable or disable Standalone Mode for the Neutrona Wand is available, which makes testing of features more user-friendly during installation. When enabled, no communication will occur with the Proton Pack even if properly attached. Be sure to disable this option for normal use or you will find that the Neutrona Wand will not control the Proton Pack as expected! Lastly, you can configure the music track names for the GPStar Neutrona Wand II in stand-alone mode Using it without a GPStar Proton Pack II . Note: Diagnostic information related to the magnetometer is shown for troubleshooting purposes. This can be disregarded for normal use. Neutrona Wand Settings The same as seen in the Neutrona Wand settings accessed from the Proton Pack above. WiFi Password Reset If you have forgotten the password to your GPStar Proton Pack II or GPStar Neutrona Wand II private WiFi network, you can reset the password via the action menu level 3 in the Neutrona Wand. See the OPERATION_MENUS for more details. Once reset, the default password will be 555-2368 Increasing WiFi Performance It should be clearly stated that the WiFi built into these boards are a low-power device. When used in a crowded (read: convention) environment the signal may become overwhelmed by competing RF devices. When possible, configure the device to connect to a stronger, stable wireless network as a client rather than relying on the built-in access point as this may improve the range and performance of the web-based interface. For Android devices offering a cellular hotspot, these devices may utilize a feature called \"Client Isolation Mode\" which will prevent hotspot clients from seeing each other. Unless you can disable this option (via a rooted device) you will not be able to reach the web UI via the hotspot network. For iOS devices offering a cellular hotspot, please make sure that the \"Maximize Compatibility\" option is enabled. This will ensure your device offers the 2.4GHz radio and will be seen by the GPStar Proton Pack II or GPStar Neutrona Wand II.","title":"GPStar II Wireless"},{"location":"WIRELESS_GPSTAR_II/#gpstar-ii-wireless-operation","text":"All devices within the GPStar ecosystem capable of operation over WiFi utilize a built-in web server which offers an API-first design for communications.

As of the 5.2.2 firmware release a special debug option is available when using the hardware as an Attenuator, or if a momentary switch is installed between pin D4 and GND on the WiFi add-on controller. While powering on the device, push down on the main dial on the Attenuator (or press the momentary switch), and the device will bypass any stored password for local WiFi. This will reset the WiFi password for the built-in WiFi network, allowing the you to log back into the device and change to a suitable password. This should only be done as a last resort to regain access to the device if the password is forgotten or another technical issue may be preventing access! As of the 6.1.0 firmware release, the password for a GPStar I wireless module can be reset by removing the ribbon cable and toggling the vibration on/off switch 5 times while the Proton Pack is not running. Firmware Flashing Please see the ATTENUATOR_FLASHING guide for details on compiling and/or uploading software to your Wireless Adapter controller. Hardware Synchronization In order to view the state of the pack and control it remotely, the Proton Pack and Attenuator or WiFi add-on devices must be physically connected and have been sychnronized via the built-in software. On the WiFi Add-on device, there are 2 on-board LEDs which will show the current status: The onboard red LED indicates the device is powered and should be accessible via the private WiFi network. A second onboard LED will be lit blue to indicate when the device has successfully synchronized with the Proton Pack. Additionally, when using the device as an Attenuator, the top most LED on that device will be lit as purple until pack synchronization has completed. If using the \"standalone\" firmware the top LED will remain lit as red. Web Interface The Attenuator or Wireless Adapter will offer a default, private WiFi network (access point) which begins with the pattern \"ProtonPack_####\" where the #### is unique to each devices's WiFi network interface, and this will be secured with a default password of \"555-2368\" .

For secured networks, only the WPA2 standard is allowed (joining an open networks is not supported nor advised). Connectivity options include either a private WiFi network from the device, and the ability to join an external WiFi network. For the latter this may be your home network or a cellular hotspot, though this is subject to some factors which are environmental or vendor-specific.","title":"Requirements"},{"location":"WIRELESS_OPERATION/#wifi-limitations","text":"It should be clearly stated that these are low-power consumer device and will not have the same range and features as a true wireless access point. When used at home or a controlled environment it should respond in a satisfactory manner. Though when used in a crowded (read: convention) environment the signal may become lost or overwhelmed by competing RF devices. When possible, configure the device to connect to a stronger, stable wireless network as a client rather than relying on the built-in access point as this may improve the range and performance of the web-based interface. For Android devices offering a cellular hotspot, these devices may utilize a feature called \"Client Isolation Mode\" which will prevent hotspot clients from seeing each other. Unless you can disable this option (via a rooted device) you will not be able to reach the web UI via the hotspot network. For iOS devices offering a cellular hotspot, please make sure that the \"Maximize Compatibility\" option is enabled. This will ensure your device offers the 2.4GHz radio and will be seen by the device.","title":"WiFi Limitations"},{"location":"WIRELESS_OPERATION/#wifi-password-reset","text":"If you have forgotten the password to your device's private WiFi network, you can load the special Attenuator-Reset.bin firmware by following the \"Forgot Your WiFi Password\" section of the ATTENUATOR_FLASHING guide . As of the 5.2.2 firmware release a special debug option is available when using the hardware as an Attenuator, or if a momentary switch is installed between pin D4 and GND on the WiFi add-on controller. While powering on the device, push down on the main dial on the Attenuator (or press the momentary switch), and the device will bypass any stored password for local WiFi. This will reset the WiFi password for the built-in WiFi network, allowing the you to log back into the device and change to a suitable password. This should only be done as a last resort to regain access to the device if the password is forgotten or another technical issue may be preventing access! As of the 6.1.0 firmware release, the password for a GPStar I wireless module can be reset by removing the ribbon cable and toggling the vibration on/off switch 5 times while the Proton Pack is not running.","title":"WiFi Password Reset"},{"location":"WIRELESS_OPERATION/#firmware-flashing","text":"Please see the ATTENUATOR_FLASHING guide for details on compiling and/or uploading software to your Wireless Adapter controller.","title":"Firmware Flashing"},{"location":"WIRELESS_OPERATION/#hardware-synchronization","text":"In order to view the state of the pack and control it remotely, the Proton Pack and Attenuator or WiFi add-on devices must be physically connected and have been sychnronized via the built-in software. On the WiFi Add-on device, there are 2 on-board LEDs which will show the current status: The onboard red LED indicates the device is powered and should be accessible via the private WiFi network. A second onboard LED will be lit blue to indicate when the device has successfully synchronized with the Proton Pack. Additionally, when using the device as an Attenuator, the top most LED on that device will be lit as purple until pack synchronization has completed. If using the \"standalone\" firmware the top LED will remain lit as red.","title":"Hardware Synchronization"},{"location":"WIRELESS_OPERATION/#web-interface","text":"The Attenuator or Wireless Adapter will offer a default, private WiFi network (access point) which begins with the pattern \"ProtonPack_####\" where the #### is unique to each devices's WiFi network interface, and this will be secured with a default password of \"555-2368\" . Alternatively, the device may simply appear as \"GPStar_Attenuator\" in later firmware releases. Once connected, your computer/phone/table should be assigned an IP address starting from \"192.168.1.100\" with a subnet of \"255.255.255.0\" . Please remember that if you intend to have multiple Attenuator/Wireless devices connect via this private WiFi network you will be assigned a unique IP address for each client device (eg. phone, tablet, or computer). A web-based user interface is available at http://192.168.1.2 to view the state of your Proton Pack and Neutrona Wand, and to manage specific actions. The available sections are described below. Note: As of the latest 5.3.x release a new mDNS feature allows the device to respond to a localized name regardless of the WiFi network. In your browser simply navigate to http://<SSID>.local where the \"SSID\" is the same name as the private access point. This SSID is now user-customizable using the \"Attenuator Settings\" page shown below.","title":"Web Interface"},{"location":"WIRELESS_OPERATION/#tab-1-equipment-status","text":"The equipment status will reflect the current state of your Proton Pack and Neutrona Wand and will update in real-time as you interact with those devices. This information is available as either a text-based or graphical display, or both if you prefer (set via Attenuator Preferences). When using the graphical display, most components of the Proton pack and Neutrona Wand are represented by color-coded overlays on the component will may be affected by runtime actions: The top of the display will indicate the mode (Standard = Mode Original, Upgraded = Super Hero) along with the year theme (V1.9.8x or V2.0.2x). When the Ion Arm switch is engaged for Mode Original, the overlay for the Ion Arm will be green to indicate a ready state. When in Super Hero mode this overlay will be green when the Proton Pack is powered on. When the Proton Pack is powered on: The Power Cell, Booster Tube, and Cyclotron overlays will be green as their default state. When the Cyclotron is in a normal state the overlay will be green. It will change to yellow then red as it goes through the pre-warning and overheat states. During venting the overlay will be blue to indicate the recovery period. The color state of the Booster Tube is linked to the \"Output\" text value which is the voltage measured at the Proton Pack PCB (in volts, but displayed as Gev). During high power draw events such as smoke generation the voltage can drop briefly, and will be reflected as a red overlay when that value is below 4.2V When the Neutrona Wand is powered on, the overlay above the Activate/Intensify portion of the gun box will indicate if the barrel is retracted (red) or extended (green). The current power level for the Neutrona Wand will be indicated by the \"L-#\" beside the barrel. The type of firing mode will be displayed below the Neutrona Wand and will be color coded via the barrel. Color intensity increases with the power level. Proton Stream: Red (includes Spectral modes) Plasm System: Green (incl. for 1989 theme) Dark Matter Gen.: Blue Particle System: Orange Settings: Gray When using the power-detection feature with a stock Haslab Neutrona Wand the default stream will be Proton with a power level of 5. Instead of the stream type being displayed, there will be a wattage value displayed as Gigawatts (GW). If the Ribbon Cable is removed, a warning icon will appear over that component to indicate an alarm state. When the Cyclotron lid is removed a radiation exposure warning will be displayed at the bottom of the CRT display. Note: When using the text-based display, if you see a \"\u2014\" (dash) beside the labels it can indicate a potential communication issue. Simply refresh the page and/or check your WiFi connection to the device. In rare cases you may need to do a reboot of the device via the admin tab.
