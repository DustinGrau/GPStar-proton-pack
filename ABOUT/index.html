Initial efforts focused on creation of a "cheat device" or more commonly referred to as a "keepalive mod" which would defeat the automatic power-down feature built into the Habro Haslab equipment. By January of 2023 most of the worldwide community were receiving their orders from Hasbro and interest in such cheat devices was growing. At this stage Michael was successful in creating a working mod though it required soldering to delicate components within the Neutrona Wand which was outside the skillset of many end-users.</p> <p>Though once a minimal keepalive solution was found, Michael began experimenting with other features such as cyclotron lights and audio upgrades. Conversations with Jonathan Gunn about potential features exposed some obvious limitations with the Haslab equipment, and so the idea of a microcontroller replacement was born. By late January the wand had a working prototype using an Arduino Nano to control the built-in hardware and work began on the pack controller. Within weeks the pack was running its core functions from an Arduino as well and both devices could communicate with each other for effects and operations. Interest from the community was growing, as was the list of requests for features.</p> <p>Progress updates continued on the GBFans forums as new prototyping work began in the background through February. The introduction of the GitHub page for all source code and project files was introduced. Work also began to prototype and beta test Michael's schematics in the community. By early March the experimental hardware and software was replicated by Dustin Grau and efforts began to formally document instructions for the community. The first true replacement to the stock Haslab controllers was on its way to adoption but only by the most-skilled users.</p> <p>Michael continued adding features and modding his equipment to accommodate community requests. Documentation turned to schematics and video demonstrations, but was still a daunting prospect to most modders. Then in April a PCB schematic was created by Jonathan which changed everything--the idea would be to combine the electronic components which lived on protoboards onto a single board powered by a ATmega2560 chip. Several revisions were rapidly created and modified, and within weeks a prototype board for the pack was created and available. By May, both the pack and wand had viable prototypes which offered the same socket connections as their replaced originals, along with user-friendly options for attaching the wand components which were originally soldered to the stock controller.</p> <p>This was the breakthrough moment for the project. Handwritten notes turned into documentation, which turned into manufactured circuits, then gave way to a means of creating drop-in controllers that would be accessible to modders with a wider range of skills. Even those with no soldering abilities could pick up a screwdriver and install these components. At this stage Angie Rutto of Frutto Technology began working with Michael to identify add-on parts that could integrate with the controllers in use and a bevvy of new options became available. Replacement lights for the power cell and cyclotron lid allowed for full-color effects on the pack, while a new bargraph unit allowed for a plug-and-play upgrade for the wand. The project was now becoming a platform with supported accessories.</p> <p>Efforts then shifted from prototyping and revisional changes to potential worldwide distribution. Polls and preorders gauged the public interest and efforts began to turn components into kits. Michael, Jonathan, and Angie took on additional roles as regional distributors covering the EU, North America, and the UK (respectively). Jonathan created the first website for ordering and modders were able to submit their choice for base kits, special upgrade kits, and optional add-ons.</p> </div> </div><footer> <div class=rst-footer-buttons role=navigation aria-label="Footer Navigation"> <a href=.. class="btn btn-neutral float-left" title=Home><span class="icon icon-circle-arrow-left"></span> Previous</a> <a href=../GUIDE_LISTING/ class="btn btn-neutral float-right" title=Introduction>Next <span class="icon icon-circle-arrow-right"></span></a> </div> <hr> <div role=contentinfo> <!-- Copyright etc --> <p>GPStar Technologies</p> </div> Built with <a href=https://www.mkdocs.org/ >MkDocs</a> using a <a href=https://github.com/readthedocs/sphinx_rtd_theme>theme</a> provided by <a href=https://readthedocs.org>Read the Docs</a>. </footer> </div> </div> </section> </div> <div class=rst-versions role=note aria-label=Versions> <span class=rst-current-version data-toggle=rst-current-version> <span><a href=.. style="color: #fcfcfc">&laquo; Previous</a></span> <span><a href=../GUIDE_LISTING/ style="color: #fcfcfc">Next &raquo;</a></span> </span> </div> <script src=../js/jquery-3.6.0.min.js></script> <script>var base_url = "..";</script> <script src=../js/theme_extra.js></script> <script src=../js/theme.js></script> <script src=../search/main.js></script> <script>
