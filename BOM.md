| 1   | Rotary Encoder (optional) | I use your standard Rotary Encoder with 24 positions. I use this instead of the Haslab one which is 5 positions I believe. I did not test out the Haslab one with my wiring, though I have no reason to believe it would not work the same. This is for the Volume control in the crank generator. | [https://www.adafruit.com/product/377](https://www.adafruit.com/product/377) |
