I hook up with tubing the mini pump which is linked in the parts list. One end of the pump creates suction and sucks the smoke in, and the other end of the pump pushes the smoke out. The vape pen itself is activating when suction is applied by the motor. The vape pens are battery powered but come with a USB cable for charging, so I can feed it 5V with a USB cable directly to the pen and not have to rely on the battery it has in it. View the Smoke Kit Guide for more information on optional smoke effects.</p> <p>When the pump is controlled with the transistor/diode setup as in the diagrams, it is the only device which draws power from the 5V rail. CAUTION: If you implement your own smoke solution using a different design, test your setup independent of the described circuit and with adequate measurement tools to ensure you will not draw power through the Arduino! Most designs which use a vape pen (cartomizer) and mini air pump require ~3.6V to run correctly, and while less than the 5V supplied to the circuit below some solutions can require nearly 1 Amp of current to run these devices together. This can also overwhelm the 2N2222 transistor used in this schematic.</p> <p>By comparison, the current required for a small fan or the vibration motor are perfectly fine for the transistors as described, while the diodes prevent any backflow of current when those devices power down (but may still spin briefly).</p> Power Connections Description BAT (+) Positive 5V from your power source.

The following are suggestions to help you minimize damage to existing wiring, unless you plan to remove all the stock components and connect new wires.</p> <ul> <li>Remove what you can of any plastic covers over the switches internally, and use a hot glue gun to carefully drip glue over the soldered ends of the toggles, rotary encoder, and any other wire connections to reinforce them as they stand.</li> <li>Gently separate any wires that are bonded together, allowing about 1\" of excess for stripping.</li> <li>Use a mechanical wire stripper to ensure you quickly strip back the sheathing for each wire.</li> <li>Use silicone-coated stranded wiring (22AWG down to 26AWG) to allow for maximum flexibility.</li> <li>Solder on extensions to every wire in the wand and use heat-shrink tubing to reinforce extended connections to make a better bond with the stock wire to prevent breakage.</li> <li>Continue the extended wire to either a PCB or the microcontroller for soldering, making sure that ALL of the strands of wire make it through the holes. Twist your bare wires tightly, and you can pre-tin the ends with a bit of solder to keep everything together as you fit the wire through any PCB holes (this also works well for making breadboard connections).</li> <li>Optionally, this is where you may consider a full replacement of some wires if they break off at the component you are connecting.</li> <li>It's too easy to have some strands that get missed which could cause a short--check your connections after soldering.

However, premodified wands are available every so often via the GPStar web store.</p> <p>Q: Can I help others install kit components or add-ons?</p> <p>A: Yes, if you are willing to offer your skills whether free or at-cost to assist others that is acceptable.</p> <p>Buyers: Please be aware that anyone performing installation work on behalf of this project is doing so as a free agent and is not associated with GPStar Technologies. This project does not warranty work performed by a 3rd party, only parts produced and shipped via agents of GPStar Technologies or Frutto Technology are warrantied in the case of manufacturing defects.</p> <p>Q: Does this replace everything in the pack/wand?</p> <p>A: This solution focuses on replacement of the microcontrollers which run the pack and wand only. It is not necessary to replace all of the switches and lights unless you truly desire to do so. Although in the case of the wand the toggle switches and every other component are attached with very thin wires, so it may be worth considering temporarily removing some items to solder better (thicker) wires to avoid breakage later.</p> <p>Q: What are the power requirements?</p> <p>A: For most every component 5V is required. We DO NOT recommend voltage higher than 5V into the VIN or barrel connector jacks on the Arduino Mega or WAV Trigger devices as they can generate quite some heat with their onboard regulators for prolonged use. A pre-regulated 5V is recommended. Total draw (amperage) depends on how many optional devices you add, but 5V at 2amps is more than enough to run various pumps, lights, etc. Please view the POWER.md guide for additional info and recommendations.</p> <p>Q: Is a Proton Pack required?</p> <p>A: No, a pack is not required for a wand-only conversion. However, please note that to run a GPStar wand board off of the Hasbro battery sled, you will need to provide your own 5V DC converter to supply regulated 5VDC to the GPStar components (see above FAQ answer). Also note that the Neutrona Wand board you receive will have the standard \"full kit\" firmware loaded. For a standalone wand build, please flash the NeutronaWand-BenchTest firmware found in the \"Extras\" folder for the wand binaries. Please see the FLASHING.md guide for information on how to flash your board.</p> <p>Q: Is a GPStar Neutrona Wand required?</p> <p>A: For a pack-only conversion a wand with a GPStar Neutrona Wand board is not required. However, a modified wand is required if you want full control of the pack from the wand. We now offer a \"Lite\" kit through Frutto Technologies which will allow an unmodified Hasbro wand to turn the Pack on and off and have the Pack respond to firing, similar to the original behavior of the stock Haslab equipment.</p> <p>Q: How many wires / pins are required for the connection between the Proton Pack and Neutrona Wand?</p> <p>A: 4 wires / pins are required (Positive, Negative, TX and RX). See the Hose Examples page for more information.</p> <p>Q: Running my vibration motors or any other DC motor is giving me noise on my sound output.</p> <p>A: It is recommended as per the schematics to move all your DC motors onto the right hand +/- rail on the 1/2 breadboard in the pack. You can also add 0.1uf ceramic capacitors across your DC motor terminals, however during testing this was not required as keeping the DC motors on a separate power rail away from the Arduino and WAV Trigger boards was more than enough to avoid any motor noise. More information can be found here if you want to learn more: Dealing with Motor Noise</p> <p>Q: Can this electronics setup run in any Proton Pack shell?</p> <p>A: In theory yes, with some minor modifications to the code depending on what type of LED setup you are using. This solution was designed primarily with the stock lights and switches in use by the Hasbro products.</p> <p>Q: Can I produce and sell kits for others for commercial purposes?</p> <p>A: Yes, the code is released under a GPLv3 License. Modifications or enhancements which may be useful to the community are encouraged to be contributed back to the original repository.</p> <p>Q: I have some cool ideas, can you add some custom bits in the code for me?</p> <p>A: Feel free to use the discussion section of the GitHub repository to talk about them. Anybody can contribute modifications or enhancements back to the repository (by use of a branch or fork) for review and final acceptance into the main branch.</p> <p>Q: Help, I fried my stock equipment or components!</p> <p>A: OK, not really a question but a common occurrence. Electrical mistakes can happen, and unfortunately there's no warranty or guarantee that this won't happen to you. The best advice is to start small and slow, checking your components work before you connect them to a soldered protoboard by use of a breadboard, first. If everything works or there are mistakes, you can hopefully catch those issues quickly before they become permanently installed. ALWAYS check your input voltages with a multimeter, and verify that you've connected any power sources to the correct device pins BEFORE you apply power. Reversing polarity is a common mistake, so use consistent colors for your positive and negative wires. It is also easy to over-power an LED, so check your resistors using a multimeter and if in doubt or short on parts use the next higher resistance than the recommended value--at the worst your LEDs will just be slightly dimmer but won't burn out. Much of this advice comes from hard-learned personal experiences--we've all been there, done that.</p>"},{"location":"FLASHING/","title":"Software Flashing Guide","text":"<p>Each supported device in the GPStar system (Proton Pack, Neutrona Wand, Attenuator, Single-shot Blaster) are separate devices and must be updated individually when software updates are available.

This solution is suggested to be undertaken if also considering adding the wand-tip strobe LED as the barrel must be significantly disassembled. Removal of the inner barrel with the LEDs for the wand is crucial, as well as a black plastic sleeve which protects the wiring from the button at the end. Remove the tape from the white wires inside the barrel before beginning this work as you'll need to remove that later!</p> <p>Preparation begins with cutting off the top of the fake pushbutton, and removing the barrel wing screws. We won't be able to completely separate it, but we can split it apart just enough to pull out the old circuit board for the selector switch. Both of these spots can be drilled out using no more than a 1/4\" (6mm) bit. Just drill through both sides, and it's expected to drill right through the old orange button. You may have to hold the button still with some pliers while you drill. </p> <p>Once the holes are drilled, you can widen the holes on the underside to fit the nuts for your orange lens and new momentery pushbutton. This will also allow more access to remove debris from inside the barrel and pull the thin white wires. </p> <p>Insert your orange lens and pushbutton from the top, and secure using their respective washer/nut combo as needed from below. It is necessary to solder on the wires for the pushbutton before installation! </p> <p>A drop of CA glue can help hold items in place while you add the securing nut. </p> <p>Once installed, it is suggested to test that you have continuity from the pushbutton wires when the button is depressed, and connect your LED and check that it both fits and illuminates from the wand PCB.  </p> <p>Fill the orange lens with hot glue and press the LED into the socket to hold it. This will be permanent once the glue hardens, so adjustment is key! Back-fill with hot glue to keep wiring in place and secured to the back of the barrel wing. You will need to drill a small hole for the wires to enter the gun barrel just where the grip meets the wand end. </p> <p>To run the wires back to the gun box you can use the internal space under the existing grip, inside the barrel which will be protected by the inner sleeve. Removing the fake rubber wires will give you a location for the wires to exit the grip and re-enter the gun box. </p> <p>To match the original Afterlife aesthetic, wrapping in black electrical tape will complete the look and keep the wiring protected. </p> <p></p> <p>The wiring in the gun box will need to cross from one side to the other. Making a small notch in the plastic in what would be above the barrel, the wiring can be run in that space to reach the PCB.

Initial efforts focused on creation of a \"cheat device\" or more commonly referred to as a \"keepalive mod\" which would defeat the automatic power-down feature built into the Habro Haslab equipment. By January of 2023 most of the worldwide community were receiving their orders from Hasbro and interest in such cheat devices was growing. At this stage Michael was successful in creating a working mod though it required soldering to delicate components within the Neutrona Wand which was outside the skillset of many end-users.</p> <p>Though once a minimal keepalive solution was found, Michael began experimenting with other features such as cyclotron lights and audio upgrades. Conversations with Jonathan Gunn about potential features exposed some obvious limitations with the Haslab equipment, and so the idea of a microcontroller replacement was born. By late January the wand had a working prototype using an Arduino Nano to control the built-in hardware and work began on the pack controller. Within weeks the pack was running its core functions from an Arduino as well and both devices could communicate with each other for effects and operations. Interest from the community was growing, as was the list of requests for features.</p> <p>Progress updates continued on the GBFans forums as new prototyping work began in the background through February. The introduction of the GitHub page for all source code and project files was introduced. Work also began to prototype and beta test Michael's schematics in the community. By early March the experimental hardware and software was replicated by Dustin Grau and efforts began to formally document instructions for the community. The first true replacement to the stock Haslab controllers was on its way to adoption but only by the most-skilled users.</p> <p>Michael continued adding features and modding his equipment to accommodate community requests. Documentation turned to schematics and video demonstrations, but was still a daunting prospect to most modders. Then in April a PCB schematic was created by Jonathan which changed everything--the idea would be to combine the electronic components which lived on protoboards onto a single board powered by a ATmega2560 chip. Several revisions were rapidly created and modified, and within weeks a prototype board for the pack was created and available. By May, both the pack and wand had viable prototypes which offered the same socket connections as their replaced originals, along with user-friendly options for attaching the wand components which were originally soldered to the stock controller.</p> <p>This was the breakthrough moment for the project. Handwritten notes turned into documentation, which turned into manufactured circuits, then gave way to a means of creating drop-in controllers that would be accessible to modders with a wider range of skills. Even those with no soldering abilities could pick up a screwdriver and install these components. At this stage Angie Rutto of Frutto Technology began working with Michael to identify add-on parts that could integrate with the controllers in use and a bevvy of new options became available. Replacement lights for the powercell and cyclotron lid allowed for full-color effects on the pack, while a new bargraph unit allowed for a plug-and-play upgrade for the wand. The project was now becoming a platform with supported accessories.</p> <p>Efforts then shifted from prototyping and revisional changes to potential worldwide distribution. Polls and preorders gauged the public interest and efforts began to turn components into kits. Michael, Jonathan, and Angie took on additional roles as regional distributors covering the EU, North America, and the UK (respectively). Jonathan created the first website for ordering and modders were able to submit their choice for base kits, special upgrade kits, and optional add-ons.</p>"},{"location":"HOSE/","title":"Pack Hose Replacements","text":"<p>In order to deliver both power and data signals to the wand, a new set of cabling is required.

For this reason many simple battery packs used by the community have been using a USB to JST-XH connector for the stock HasLab equipment.</p> <p>For most audio amplifier choices used with the pack those devices typically require 9-12V. Meanwhile, the components required for smoke kits may use as little as 3.7V or require up to 12V.</p> <p>Note: You will most likely be using a rechargeable lithium-ion battery or similar to power your equipment. Unlike Alkaline batteries these do not drop in voltage as they discharge, but keep up a continuous voltage until their capacity is nearly depleted--at which time the internal circuitry will simply stop providing output. As such, reading voltage is not a reliable means of estimating battery life remaining.</p> <p>2025 Update - The new GPStar Amplifier II and Power Hub II devices now allow your system to be 24V compatible.

You will need a power source which can deliver at least 0.6A to run the most basic kit, while additional upgrades such as the 48-LED barrel will require a minimum of 0.8A to run effectively. The 12V batteries offered by Talentcell are a popular choice as they provide up to 2A from the USB port and 3A from the 12V barrel jack.</p> <p>Next is the matter of how long you may wish to run your pack. For those who \"troop\" or will use their equipment for events, you need a long runtime which is a factor of the battery's Amp-Hour rating (typically stated in milli-Amp-hour or mAh). To estimate how long your battery will last you would need to know how many Amps are required to run your kit at a maximum, then divide the mAh rating by Amps. For example, a 3000mAh battery is equivalent to 3Ah, which at a constant 0.8A draw would run for approximately 3.75hrs.</p> <p>June 2024 Update - Since the advent of this kit several components have been added as optional equipment, and some as alternatives to original parts. When using the pack and wand controllers with GPStar Audio boards, an ESP32 and Attenuator kit, all possible wand lighting upgrades, and the GPStar Amplifier the total power draw is around 0.35A at idle and around 0.93A while firing all effects.

What do you mean, 'bad'?\" -Dr. Venkman</p> <ul> <li> <p>For purposes of a DIY approach, in no case should you use the Arduino Mega's barrel jack to convert 12VDC into 5VDC for that board, nor use the 5V pin on the controller for running any other devices. The power converter on the microcontroller can become hot and may burn out over time, or you could easily draw more power than the Arduino can sustain, causing the need to replace the entire controller. Your best option is to utilize the 5V pin (and GND) to power any Arduino controllers which should come from a stable regulated 5V power source. The D-cell batteries supplied with the stock equipment may not be sufficient for the long runtimes expected by the solutions offered by these guides--furthermore, Alkaline batteries will exhibit a voltage drop as they drain which can fall below the minimum necessary to run the Arduino controllers.</p> </li> <li> <p>Any battery pack which uses PD (power delivery) is not recommended, nor is use of USB-C connections as these could potentially supply up to 100W of power and could destroy your equipment. Using standard USB-A connections is recommended as there are dedicated power wires which are easy to access from a modified cable and is typically limited to 2-3 Amps for output.</p> </li> <li> <p>Putting too high a load on a rechargeable battery is not good long-term for the battery or the components. The battery will be limited to a maximum output in terms of both voltage and camperage. In some cases this can present as degraded behavior for the component (eg. smoke air pumps run slower) or it could affect the controllers causing stuttering or other unexpected behavior. You are encouraged to put high-draw devices on their own separate battery or otherwise limit smoke effects to 1 device per battery if sharing with the pack/wand electronics.</p> </li> <li> <p>When using the new GPStar Amplifier in your Proton Pack, do not run more than 1 smoke device (vape coil + air pump) from any of the provided 5V JST-XH connections. The built-in voltage regulator can only provide a maximum of 3A, and when running all of the pack/wand components plus a single 5V smoke device can easily approach that maximum.

Please proceed only if you are comfortable with irreversible modifications. One such recommended modification is the full removal of the D-Cell battery compartment which will allow access through the battery door to installed vape coils for easy refilling. Other modifications include drilling holes to fit wires and/or silicone tubing.</p> <p>In both the PCB and DIY approaches each of the smoke and fan pins are designed to use a transistor to run connected devices, as most devices will require more than the recommended 40mA maximum of current through the ATMega controller. Please note the following guidelines and warnings regarding safe connection of these devices:</p> <ul> <li>All connectors listed above provide 5V of DC power and are intended to power devices such as relays, pumps, and fans.</li> <li>Do not connect any device which draws more than 500mA of current to your controller. Most fans/blowers and relays can be safely attached to the Fan1 or Fan2 ports without concern as these require 500mA or less to operate. The LED-W port expects a white LED with a forward voltage of 3.0-3.2V and current draw of 20mA.</li> <li>The Proton Pack PCB has been tested using up to 2 Amps of current but is NOT recommended as some components may be pushed to their thermal limits and could potentially fail prematurely under extended use.</li> <li>Most vape coil and air pump combinations require dedicated power sources or may require a 12V power source.</li> <li>ALWAYS use a relay module to complete the circuit to power these types of devices!</li> </ul>"},{"location":"SMOKE/#powering-a-kit","title":"Powering a Kit","text":"<p>Power should be provided as recommended by your kit manufacturer. Most kits run on either 5V or 12V sources so this will determine the best way to implement a power connection. Though in most cases kits operate on the principle of \"apply power, get smoke\" so the only concern is how to turn the 5V (HIGH) signal from the PCB or Arduino into something which can safely run a vape coil and air pump combination. So we have 2 steps to take: 1) how to get power for the smoke kit(s) and 2) how to switch on power safely.</p> <p>Now before we begin with how to power your kit, take a look at this video which shows the correlation between voltage to the vape coil and how much amperage is consumed during operation. Typically most vape coils used with many kits are 1.8ohms and like their voltage in the range of 3.3-4V, though 5V can and will work fine. Just remember that more voltage means more current, which means more strain on your battery. So if you are short on available power or have a reduced runtime you can potentially look at reducing the voltage by use of a buck converter for just the vape coil itself.</p> <p></p> <p>Step 1: Providing Power</p> <p>As of mid-2024 there are now 2 standard options available for obtaining power easily from a Talentcell battery: the GPStar Amplifier and the GPStar Power Hub. Both devices accept 12VDC from the 5525 barrel jack on the common Talentcell batteries, and both use an on-board 5V regulator which is capable of delivering up to 3A of power.</p> <p>WARNING Do not operate more than 1 smoke kit from the amplifier. This device must consume power to run the speakers, and is also meant to provide power easily to the Proton Pack controller. This can result in pushing the voltage converter (and battery) to its stated limit and will result in poor performance from attempting to run 2 smoke kits simultaneously.</p> <p></p> <p>The power hub device is meant to provide dedicated power to high-current devices. It has been tested by operating 2 smoke kits (5V each, at ~1.5A) simultaneously without issue. The primary and expected use-case is when used with a second Talentcell battery reserved exclusively for powering smoke effects.</p> <p></p> <p>Some additional but optional parts which may be required for these devices:</p> <ul> <li>2-Pin JST-XH Connectors w/ Wires - For connecting relay modules to the 5V ports on the amp or power hub.</li> <li>Male USB w/ Short Pigtail Cable - For connecting directly to the USB port of a Talentcell battery.</li> <li>Male 5.5mm x 2.5mm Pigtail Cable - For connecting the amp to a battery using the available terminal screws.</li> <li>Male-to-Male 5.5mm x 2.5mm Cable - For connecting the amp or power hub to a Talentcell battery.</li> </ul> <p>Step 2: Switching Power</p> <p>As previously noted in the warnings section, this is where a 5V Relay Module becomes necessary. For a 5V relay, this device will electrically isolate the power provided by the PCB or Arduino from the power source running the smoke generator. This is the recommended solution for safely turning on your smoke generator. Remember that most vape coils will draw 1.5 to 2 Amps so your power supply must be able to provide that safely without triggering a safety shutoff.</p> <p></p> <p>Most relays work using 3 wires: 2 for power (+/-) to the relay itself, and 1 for the signal to turn the relay on or off. One solution is to use a relay which can accept a HIGH signal to turn on and use the + connection to drive both the relay power and input signal. This arrangement typically uses less than 100mA and can safely connect to the Smoke1 or Smoke2 connectors.</p> <p></p> <p>Typically the vape coil and air pump will have their positive leads connected together, and the negative leads connected together. The positive from the power source will be connected to the NO (normally-open) terminal on the relay module while the combined positive leads are connected to the COM (common) terminal. The negative leads should connect directly to the power source for the smoke generator.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"SMOKE/#connection-examples","title":"Connection Examples","text":"<p>For a more in-depth look at the electrical connections, the following diagrams demonstrate what is required for integrating several smoke kits available from the community.
