# Microcontroller Replacements for the Haslab Spengler Series Proton Pack and Neutrona Wand

This repository outlines the full replacement of the stock microcontrollers which run the Proton Pack and Neutrona Wand while retaining the use and function of all existing switches and lights. This is an advanced build-out which requires opening all devices and performing a significant amount of soldering. **Proceed with caution, regardless of your skillset or abilities.**

The process is outlined through use of multiple guides, starting with a list of all parts and materials needed, and moving through the preparation of the hardware and software before modifying the pack and wand themselves. Lastly, there is an operation manual for navigating the various features within the new controllers.

### "Yes, have some"...music!

Special thanks to Michael Klodzinksi for graciously allowing us to include his version of [Savin' The Day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shJslMSAxE0) as a bundled music file to demo your awesome proton pack mods! Check out his other works at [michaelk.net](https://michaelk.net).

*"You know, it just occurred to me that we really haven't had a successful test of this equipment." -Ray Stantz*

Except that we have! Here is a [Walkthrough Video Contributed by JustinDustin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnfljGd5-uU) (YouTube) showcasing several of the stock features in a converted pack/wand combination. Several optional features were implemented as part of this build.
