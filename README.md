# Microcontroller Replacements for the Haslab Spengler Series Proton Pack and Neutrona Wand

This repository outlines the full replacement of the stock microcontrollers which run the Proton Pack and Neutrona Wand while retaining the use and function of all existing switches and lights. This is an advanced build-out which requires opening all devices and soldering. Proceed with caution.

The process is outlined in the following guides, starting with a list of all parts and materials needed, and moving through the preparation of the hardware and software before modifying the pack and wand themselves. Lastly, there is an operation manual for navigating the various features within the new controllers.
