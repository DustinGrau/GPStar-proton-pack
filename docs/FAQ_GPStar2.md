# GPStar II FAQ

## 🔊 Audio & Amplifier

**Q:** Do I need to replace my WAV Trigger with the new GPStar Audio board?  
**A:** No, WAV Trigger is still supported. The GPStar Audio board offers advantages (smaller form factor for wand installs, smoother audio transitions, louder output, and integrated features like a 5V regulator and ground loop isolator), but existing WAV Triggers will continue to work.  

**Q:** Should I upgrade to the GPStar Amplifier II?  
**A:** The main benefit is simplified wiring: built-in 5V regulator (3A), ground loop isolator, and cleaner install. Not required, but recommended if you want easier setup.  

**Q:** How are sound effects updated — OTA or SD card?  
**A:** Audio updates still require removing the SD card. OTA updates only apply to firmware. Fortunately, audio updates are infrequent.

## 🔌 Compatibility & Upgrades

**Q:** Can I mix Gen 1 boards with Gen 2 (wand and pack)?  
**A:** Mixing is not recommended. Gen 1 uses 5V logic, while Gen 2 uses 3.3V, so signals aren’t directly compatible. An adapter may come later if there’s enough demand.  

**Q:** What’s the easiest upgrade path from Gen 1 to GPStar II?  
**A:** If you already have a GPStar/Frutto bargraph and RGB cyclotron panel, you only need to swap the wand and pack boards. The old Hasbro 5-LED bargraph and individual cyclotron LEDs are no longer supported.  

**Q:** Will GPStar II work with smoke kits and the Wi-Fi Attenuator?  
**A:** Yes, smoke kits remain fully supported. If you connect an Attenuator, it acts as the “Wi-Fi master” to conserve power. Without one, the pack or wand handles Wi-Fi.

## 🎒 Proton Pack & Wand Installation

**Q:** How hard is it to install a GPStar II kit?  
**A:** Installing in the pack is straightforward (TalentCell battery, board swap, bargraph/audio board hookup). Modifying the wand is more involved, but there are excellent how-to videos available (from GPStar and NorCal Ghostbusters).  

**Q:** Should I install the Wand II board if I already have a Pack I board?  
**A:** For now, don’t mix old and new boards due to voltage differences. Benefits of the new wand board include OTA updates and new sensor features (gyroscope, magnetometer, etc.).  

**Q:** Are there videos or instructions available?  
**A:** Yes, demonstration and install videos are planned, and community guides already exist.

## 👻 Ghost Trap

**Q:** Are there upgrades for the Haslab/Frutto traps?  
**A:** Yes. Planned upgrades include:  
- Accurate bargraph  
- Screen-accurate sequence/sounds  
- Native smoke machine control  
- Louder audio  
- Proper “no ghosts” mode  
- Wi-Fi configuration & updates  
- Wireless sync with GPStar II wand  

**Q:** Where can I get trap boards?  
**A:** Trap boards are developed and sold by Frutto Technology. Pricing will be announced once firmware is ready.

## 📦 Orders & Shipping

**Q:** I already placed an order. Can I switch to GPStar II boards?  
**A:** Yes, if your order hasn’t shipped yet, it can be modified. Kits that haven’t shipped will include the new boards automatically.  

**Q:** Will shipping delays affect delivery?  
**A:** Postal services are temporarily affected by new US tariff system updates, but couriers (FedEx, etc.) are not impacted. Most delays should be resolved before boards start shipping.

## 🛠 Miscellaneous

**Q:** What new features does GPStar II add?  
**A:** ESP32-S3 dual-core processor, Wi-Fi/Bluetooth, OTA firmware updates, 6-axis gyroscope, magnetometer, temperature/humidity sensors, extra ports, expansion support, and GPStar Lite integration.  

**Q:** Will there be a TVG (Video Game) kit?  
**A:** Yes, development is in progress.
