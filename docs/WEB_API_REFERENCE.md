# Web-Based API Reference

This guide will cover the web interface available via an Attenuator or standalone WiFi add-on which offers a visual, web-based UI capable of controlling operations of your Proton Pack and Neutrona Wand.

While this guide is primarily targeted to the UI from an **Attenuator** (or standalone WiFi add-on). For use of the GPStar Proton Pack II and GPStar Neutrona Wand II controllers you should view the dedicated [GPStar II Wireless Guide](WIRELESS_GPSTAR_II.md).

## Background

The web UI is built as a single-page application, using single HTML pages for the static interface elements and performing actions using an API layer. These API endpoints are available for use if you wish to build your own interface. They pass data in JSON format though the exact structure is not described here at this time.

## File Requests

The following URI's will serve the informational/maintenance pages as shown in the wireless operation guides. These are listed for you to observe how the API's may be called and how data is used for changing states within the UI:

    GET / - Standard Index/Landing Page
    GET /network - External WiFi Settings Page
    GET /password - WiFi Password Update Page
    GET /settings/device = Special Device Settings Page
    GET /settings/pack - Pack Settings Page
    GET /settings/wand - Wand Settings Page
    GET /settings/smoke - Smoke Settings Page
    GET /style.css - Common Stylesheet
    GET /common.js - Common JavaScript
    GET /index.js - Index Page JavaScript

## API Reference

The following URI's are API endpoints available for managing actions within your devices. You may use these to create your own UI or control your available hardware devices. For instance, you can monitor the `/status` endpoint for changes, or use the volume/music endpoints to create your own jukebox interface. All data should use the `application/json` content type for sending or receiving of data. Where applicable for body data to be sent to the device a footnote describes where to find a sample of the JSON payload.

## WebSockets

All of the API endpoints previously highlighted work on a "poll" or "pull" mechanism. This means that in order to get information from endpoints such as `/status` you would need to constantly make a request at regular intervals to obtain data. This is inefficient and can put unnecessary load on the device when no interactions have occurred.

Instead, when real-time updates are required we can instead have the devices "push" information as it happens directly from user input or other events. The built-in web server offers a special URI endpoint `/ws` to support [WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API). This is much more efficient as it 1) only sends data as the system changes states, and 2) is meant to report only the information necessary for interactions.

All devices support the WebSocket output, which primarily reports the current device status and is updated after specific system actions occur. Note that while this data will always be in the form of a JSON object, some events may send a plain string, so always check the contents of the text data carefully before usage to ensure you are working with the expected data format.
