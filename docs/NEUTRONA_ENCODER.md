# GPStar Neutrona Encoder

This is an ultra compact and slim encoder for Neutrona Wand's to connect the top dial of the Neutrona Wand so you can adjust the power levels and various settings of your GPStar Neutrona Wand. Meant for Mack's Factory, custom and DIY builds, this should fit all Neutrona Wand shells.
