# Cyclotron Lights

These are *OPTIONAL* additions for use within the Proton Pack.

## Light Switch Panel (Optional)

There is a included STL file that you can 3D Print to replace the cyclotron switch plate. You can add 5mm LED's into here. See reference in the [Pack Setup](PACK.md) for wiring to the Arduino Mega. You can use cliplites to hold the LEDâ€™s in place. Refer to the parts list on where to source them.

## Inner Cyclotron Lights (Optional)

Currently you can chain 8 NeoPixel Jewels together and then you can run them inside a modified inner cyclotron or any 3D printable one. See reference in the [Pack Setup](PACK.md) for wiring to the Arduino Mega. Each NeoPixel jewel you chain them together from 5V IN, GND IN, IN to 5V Out, GND OUT and OUT pins on the Jewels.
